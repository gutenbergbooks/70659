<h2 class="nobreak" id="I">I</h2>

<p class="drop-cap">She put her hand to the curtain for the last
time and drew back. Very reluctantly she
admitted to herself that now there was nothing
left to do. Here was the room really finished at
last, and none of her wistful glances from side to
side could find her a fresh task. She had
lingered over it as long as she possibly could,
but now the pleasant work had really come to an
end. Everything had to come to an end so that
other things might begin, but the hours of toil
had been so sweet that she hated to let them go.
The room seemed full of the tunes she had sung
as she painted and scrubbed, full of plans and
pleased thoughts and thrills of housewifely
pride. It stood, of course, for so very much
more than just a simply-furnished chamber in
a simple house. It stood, for instance, for the
end of a self-reproach marring a happiness
otherwise complete. It meant the comforting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
of a hurt which still troubled her kind soul,
however unwillingly it had been wrought. It
meant return and renewal on better lines,
the rebuilding of ancient things with better
hands....</p>

<p>In the upstairs room of the marsh farmhouse
there was a great pleasantness and peace. The
early evening sun drove straight towards it
from the west, and through its deep-set eyes
sent shining ladders all across the floor. Only the
corners of the room stayed dim and aloof.</p>

<p>Now that all was done, and so thoroughly
done, she was puzzled to find herself depressed.
Perhaps it was nothing more than the nervous
doubt which foreruns every great moment just
at the last. Perhaps it was just the regret that
lies like a sigh under the chant of pride in a
finished task. Certainly, nobody else would
ever see the room exactly as it looked to herself.
Nobody would see, as she could see, not only
the finished whole, but the work and the joy
that had made it what it was. That meant, of
course, that when she passed out for the last
time, the room’s own perfect moment would
pass as well. Therefore she lingered and looked,
hoping for the chance of a further touch, but
however she looked, she could think of nothing
else.</p>

<p>Even after she had ceased to wonder she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
could not tear herself away. The low room was
not only a room, such as anybody might prepare
for a guest; it was a refuge, a place for himself
that she had made for a stray. She had stained
the floor with her own hands, and washed the
knitted quilt on the bed. She had made the
white valances with their borders of knitted
lace, the cloth rug by the bedside, the white
window-curtains with their pleated frills. She
had distempered the white walls and polished
the chest of drawers so that the brass-bound
Bible on its top was reflected deeply as in a
pool. All the paint was white; perhaps she
was proudest of the paint. The new bedstead
was iron, with brass knobs crowning its slender
posts. In a crinkly vase on one sill was a posy
of coloured flowers.... Surely the old man
would be able to rest here?</p>

<p>The windows of the room were so full of sun
that they looked like translucent plates of
beaten gold. Beyond them, the scene was so
bright that it hurt the eye—the river shining
and glinting close below the farm, the sands all
sparkling as if they were sown with quartz,
and the houses across the bay snow-white against
the hill. The tide was dead out—at the end of
the world it seemed; yet never at any time was
it very far. Always, when you had forgotten it,
it came stealing back, a thief in the night, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
trespasser by day. Even now she had not grown
used to the tides, though she did not look out
of the windows all the time, as she had done
when she first arrived on the marsh. But he,
when he came, would look out of the windows
all day long.... She stood in the long rays,
staring round the room, her blue eyes frowning
a little as she looked. Her young, firm figure
was full of energy and strength. Her dark hair
was ruffled and her cheek flushed with the final
effort that was actually the last.</p>

<p>Very soon now the old man would be here,
and the room that had once been his for so long
would be his again. He would find things a
good deal changed, it was true, but how much
for the better, after all! No doubt the place
had been well enough once, years and years ago,
perhaps, when he was first wed, but it had been
only a poor spot later on. It had had a neglected
look from the outside, and the fields and
hedges seemed to ask for a hand. At the last,
of course, it had been a desolate place, indeed....
By accident, as it happened, she had seen
the room before he left, and the desolation of it
still haunted her mind. The old wooden bedstead
had been rickety all through, and there
was never a mat on the bare, unvarnished boards.
In the quilt grown thin as a rag there was a
jagged tear, and in each of the ceiling-corners a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
spider had spun a web. The once blue-washed
walls had faded a dirty grey, and the plaster
was crumbling away where the damp had driven
in. The windows had broken hasps, and one
had a broken pane; all dim they were, mysterious
with crusted salt ... and by the bed had
stood a pair of old woman’s shoes. She remembered
the shoes because they had been his wife’s.
It was weeks, she remembered—months—after
she was dead.</p>

<p>A dismal room indeed it had seemed to the
girl, a forlorn place thoroughly in tune with a
forlorn human old age. She remembered how
she laid hands on it, then as now, mending the
quilt and fetching the spiders from their homes,
spending a lusty scrubbing on the floor. Even
then she had had a vision of what she would some
day make of the place, plotting and planning
and laughing as she toiled. She had never put
her head inside that room, it seemed, but some
web of contrival at once began to spin. Of course
it was not exactly as she had planned, because
every creation meddles with the tools, but it
was near enough to satisfy her, nevertheless. It
was inevitable somehow ... intended ... definitely
right. It seemed inevitable, too, that
she herself should be here, although she had
questioned and delayed her fate so long. She
felt sure, when she looked back, that she had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
known it to be inevitable all the time; that
just the same personal interest had gone to that
far-away putting of things to rights. But she
had not been ready for Thomas, just then, and
the future had had to take care of itself.
Thomas’s father, however, had not been able to
care for himself. In the midst of her indecision
he had had to quit. The trouble had gone
further than just an unswept room....</p>

<p>And yet, in spite of the intervening break,
her fate and the room’s fate had fulfilled themselves
in time. She had come in the end to the
place ordained, just as the changes she had
meant for the room had come about. Now it
was all scoured clean, painted and stained, with
a new iron bed that had full command of its
legs, and four little knobs like four little globes
of gold. Her second scrubbing had been so
thorough that it almost seemed as if there was
nothing of the old room left. Even the dust
and dimness had had a character of their own,
and both of them had been swept away. Even
the windows looked a different shape now they
were frames for those shining plaques of gold.
They were like young eyes now, shining and
clear, where before they were ancient and
blurred with tears ... eyes with a whole
world behind them under the sky, instead of
blankness staring at nothing without sight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span></p>

<p>Yet something lingered that belonged to the
old room, something that was perhaps nothing
more than a question in the air. That was the
reason, perhaps, why she hesitated to call her
work complete, since the room seemed to cry
upon her for something else. It seemed to be
waiting for something to come back; she wondered
vaguely if it was the old woman’s shoes.
She would have brought them back right willingly
if she could, but she had never seen
or heard of them since that day. Probably they
had gone at the sale, or simply been lost or
burnt or thrown away. It was out of the question,
anyhow, to think of finding them now. If
the room was waiting for that, it would have to
do without.</p>

<p>She felt sure that, even in its best days, the
room had never looked so fine, even in those
far-off days when the house had freshened itself
for another bride. There might have been curtains,
perhaps—perhaps not upstairs—but almost
certainly there had been no blinds. Little
need for them, indeed, with windows facing the
lone sands, and a white-sailed yacht at the flood
the only passer-by. And she was certain that,
not for years, if ever before, had roses been set
upon the sill.</p>

<p>There was no doubt, however, that rooms,
like folks, were growing smarter with the times.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
Old as he was, the old man would know that,
and would feel, if only unconsciously, the finer
touch. He would be proud of a son’s wife who
had such ways; straight from his present
home, indeed, how could he be anything
but proud? And progress and new paint
had not harried the old-time peace of the
room, nor could she herself have done it real
harm. The tradition behind her was too pure
for that, the abiding spirit of the house too
strong.</p>

<p>Rousing herself, she crossed the rays towards
the door, but stopped on her way to run her
hand along the quilt. The limbs that would lie
under it would be snug enough, she thought,
the head on the pillow would surely lie still.
Stooping, she came on something soft to her
foot, and started hastily aside. It was almost
as if she had trodden and crushed the worn,
old shoes.... But it was only the new cloth
rug beside the bed.</p>

<p>Out on the landing she paused again, feeling
the evening stillness warm through all the house.
There were empty rooms right and left of her,
empty, yet full of secrets, as empty rooms always
are. When other things went out of the rooms,
they filled them for themselves. Yet, in spite
of their secrets, they seemed lonely sometimes,
consciously waiting, like the room she had left;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
but to-night they were only full of the sunny
peace. She looked into them, one after the other,
and shut them up again, and then out in the
passage stood gazing at the doors. It was
strange to live in a house with so many empty
rooms. It was like living with people who never
spoke, but were busily thinking all the time. A
house with empty rooms could never be at its
best. Something might come out of that brooding
silence, such things as come from a mind
for ever feeding on itself. She was sure that,
when the winter nights came, she would start
thinking of those empty rooms upstairs, hear
voices, perhaps, and steps ... if she left them
too long to think things by themselves. She
would put apples in one, she determined, when
the fruit was ripe; cheeses in another, when she
started making cheese. There would be other
things after a while to fill the rest—other things,
other people, other thoughts—so that the rooms
would not have time to grow lonely and queer.
And at least one of them would have finished
with being lonely by to-night. She found herself
turning again to the room where her work was
done, and only stopped herself at the handle of
the door. Then she heard her husband moving
in the kitchen below, and her dreamy mood fell
from her and she ran down. There was carpet
under her feet, she thought, as she ran. How<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
many years since the old man had seen new
carpet on those stairs?</p>

<p>Thomas had been busy redding himself up,
and turned towards her a tanned but shining
face. He was still in his working clothes, but
he had shaved, and slipped his jacket over his
rolled-up sleeves. There was health in the clean
lines of his jaw and the warm colours of his
skin, and kindness and honesty in his tranquil
eyes. Only his mouth, firmly-cut and set,
showed that he could be obstinate if driven too
far. This was a man who saw one road at a
time, and when once he was set on it could not
turn aside. Agnes had known that face when it
was dogged and harsh, heard passion and bitterness
in the slow, deep voice, seen tortured and
angry strength in the broad, slow form. But
that was long ago, of course, before she had
come to her senses and seen clear. To-night,
Thomas’s face shone as much with pleasure as
with soap. Everything was an occasion for his
smile, the slowly-broadening smile which thought
before it came. He smiled as he turned instinctively
towards the stair. He had not yet
ceased to watch for her coming in. Often and
often he had seen her in his mind before she was
really there in front of his eyes. Now, as he
watched, he saw her soft, blue gown paint itself
clear on the dusk beyond the door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span></p>

<p>The sun was in the kitchen, too, but in far
greater power, because of the wider windows
and the open porch, that was like some arching
cave with a golden tide at the flood. Almost
everything in the kitchen was new, and everything
was scrubbed and polished as it had been
upstairs. The dresser was as white as when the
timber first yielded to the saw. The plates in
the pot-rail were so many circular mirrors in
the sun. And everything spoke of new housekeeping
and newly-wedded pride. The legs of
the table were shapely and smooth, unworn by
the marks of large or little boots, unscarred by
the clawings of generations of cats. There was
an arm-chair to the side of the flashing fender
and the modern range, an expensive-looking
chair, with its castors shining and whole, its
covers unfaded and its padding plump. The
grandfather’s clock had not yet settled to his
corner place. Behind the warming-pan with
its flat gold face, there was never a mark on the
pale-coloured wall.</p>

<p>Out in the little garden the box hedges and
borders looked almost black, making the roses
between them a warmer, deeper red, and whitening
the white rose over the cavern that was the
porch. Beside the parlour window a tall yew
stood up, clipped like Cleopatra’s needle and as
straight. The little garden had peculiarly the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
air of refuge and close, set as it was between the
desolation of the sands and the lesser and different
desolation of the marsh. The marsh was lonely,
of course, but Nature was always there, growing
her grass and plants and flowers, her acorns and
cones fashioning into trees, her thorn hedges
throwing up every year their close and towering
screens; and, after Nature, man, with his
cattle and thin ploughs, his barns and shippons,
his clustered chimney-stacks. But out on the
sand there were only sand and lost shells, and the
goalless footprints of flown birds. It was enemy
ground, where neither blown seed nor human
hearth might take hold. The marsh had a
peace of its own as well as its fear; but out on
the sands there was only fear.</p>

<p>One window in the kitchen pretended to itself
that there was neither sand nor fear. It looked
across the square fields to the higher land
behind the marsh, over tall hedges thick with
rose to sloping meadowland and woods. Up
in the sky was a climbing, high-hung road, and
below it a hidden village with a seeking spire.
On the marsh between the straight hedges all
the roads ran straight.... It was to this
window that Agnes crossed to look out.</p>

<p>“Hadn’t you best be getting off?” she
enquired, pressing her face against the pane.
“It’ll never do to be hanging about and miss<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
your time. He’ll likely think he’s not wanted if
you’re a bit behind.”</p>

<p>“Nay, there’s no call to be off yet,” Thomas
replied tranquilly, without offering to move.
“We’ll catch a sight on ’em on t’road, long
afore they’re here.” He settled his jacket
leisurely, looking at himself in the little kitchen
glass, mottled and cracked in its worn mahogany
frame. It looked old and strange on the new
face of the wall—almost the only thing in the
kitchen that wasn’t new. “’Twas half-past
six, wasn’t it, they said? It wants a bit to
that yet.”</p>

<p>“What was it you went and settled wi’ Bob,
after all?”</p>

<p>“I was to meet ’em at meader gate so as to
give the old man an arm. It’s over rough
riding up for him, I doubt. He’ll be best on
his feet by a deal.”</p>

<p>“Ay, old bones can’t abide being rumbled
about. I shouldn’t wonder but he’s a bit shaky
after his ride, so you mun be sure to be there on
the tick.... Eh, well, we’ll have him as right
as a bobbin afore so long!”</p>

<p>“It’ll take a while, will that!” Thomas
frowned. Staring, he saw the face in the glass
grow older and rather grim. “He’s been going
downhill sharp, lately, has the old chap. Last
time I was at the cottage he give me a fair fright.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
It was a bad job his having to gang to Marget
an’ Bob.”</p>

<p>He could see his wife through the glass beyond
himself, and the face that she turned to
him was clouded, too.</p>

<p>“Nay, what...” she began quickly, her
voice troubled and sore. “That’s by with,
surely? You promised you’d let it bide.”</p>

<p>Their eyes met in the glass, and he threw her
a repentant nod. “Ay, that’s so, and I mean
to hold by it an’ all.” He drew a long breath,
squaring his shoulders as if to an enemy threatening
his peace. For a long moment he went
on staring thoughtfully at himself, and when he
spoke again it was with an obvious attempt at
ease. “I reckon I don’t favour the old dad
much in the face; nay, nor Bob, neither, for
the matter o’ that.”</p>

<p>“You don’t take after him no way,” Agnes
answered, turning back. She gave a little sigh
of relief as she stared again at the marsh.
“Folk’d be hard put to it to tell you’re the same
breed. He’s the light sort, for one thing, and
you’re that dark. He’s fond of music and terble
forgetful-like, and you’re that set on your job,
and wi’ no more tune than an old bull.”</p>

<p>Thomas laughed his good-tempered laugh.</p>

<p>“I’m not much in the singing line, I doubt,
but I’m real fond o’ music, all the same. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
was for ever trying to learn me the fiddle, but
it wasn’t no use. All the music I’ve gitten is in
my heels.”</p>

<p>“Ay, well, you’re a bonny dancer—I’ll give
you that,” she agreed. “So was Bob, poor lad,
afore he got wed, but he’s not much to crack
on, nowadays, I doubt. All the spring’ll be out
on him, by now. He’s been plagued and bothered
over long.”</p>

<p>“A bad missis’ll do for a man quicker than
a green Christmas,” Thomas said. “There’s
nobbut once he’ll have rued, I reckon, and that’s
all the time. He’d plenty o’ warning an’ all, if
he’d nobbut took it, the daft fool! I never see
such a time as she give him when they were
courting—Marget an’ Bob. Same as cat and
mouse it were, only worse, and yet he couldn’t
frame to bide away. Come to that, he’d say
we were a while about it, ourselves....”</p>

<p>He saw her stiffen again as he said that, but
this time she did not turn. Only the back of
her smooth head was visible in the glass. “Ay,
well, I’m one as looks afore they leap,” she
answered shortly, on a sharp note.... “Hadn’t
you best be thinking o’ making a move?”</p>

<p>“It’s over soon, I tell ye ... there’s no sign
o’ them yet.” Suddenly he left the glass and
came over to her side, leaning his arms along
the window-frame. All the windows in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
kitchen were new, their sashes gleaming with
fresh paint, broad windows that filled the place
with pictures and the sun. “Seems like it
couldn’t be true,” he went on, looking down at
her cheek where it touched the stuff of his
sleeve—“you an’ me wed and at the farm, and
the old dad coming back, after all. Seems like
I’m only dreaming it’s come true.... I doubt
he’ll want seeing to a bit, at first. He’s not as
young as he was, and he’s terble down. You an’
me we mun do for him all we can.”</p>

<p>“We’ll see to him, don’t you fret!” Agnes
said cheerfully, in her firm tones. “We’ll have
him so he won’t know himself afore long, wi’
nowt to cross him and the best to eat. It’s
queer if we can’t shape better than Marget at
the job. We ought to be shammed on ourselves
if we can’t, that’s all!”</p>

<p>As if bent upon showing her willingness to
begin, she left him to pick up the white cloth
ready spread for a meal, and shook it on again
with a hearty slap. Thomas, searching the
roads of the marsh in her place, heard her busy
behind him among the pots, her free step over
the flags full of energy and goodwill. The clean
air of the kitchen thrilled with kindly expectation
and innocent pride. The sun and the
cheerful room seemed the best setting in the
world for the little scene of welcome that they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
had planned. Even the weather had kept the
right sort of day for the old man’s coming home.
Then it was evening, early evening, when all
should go home by rights to rest and good food
and cheerful voices and open doors—doors,
flooded with sun which you took with you
when you went in, yet left as much as they
wanted for those outside; food, such as was
being laid on the table behind; and a voice
like his wife’s as she murmured over her job.
“Father’ll think they forks right smart,” he
heard her say; and, “It’s the bonniest china,
I’m sure, I’ve seen for a while!” Between the
setting of every two or three pots she asked
for news of the trap.... “Likely they’ll have
got off afore their time.”</p>

<p>“Nay, Marget’ll watch out for that!”
Thomas scoffed. “It’s a deal more like to be
the other way about. She was fair wild when
she heard he meant coming to us, though I
don’t see how she could ha’ looked for owt else.
What, he was born here, to start wi’, and never
stirred off the spot; and then, when his father
give up, he took hold for himself. I’m sure it’s
like enough he should want to come back.”</p>

<p>“He’s bound to hanker to be back on the
marsh,” she agreed, admiring the plated tea-pot
with an absent air.... “It was real kind
of Aunt Martha Bainbridge to give us yon....”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span></p>

<p>“Ay, he’s hankered right enough!” Thomas
said, with so much bitterness in his voice that
it startled even himself. Agnes came out of
her meditation with a jerk, and the little cloud
settled again on her face. She looked anxiously
at her husband’s back, which seemed to have
taken on the sudden harshness of his mood.
“’Tisn’t as if Marget had wanted him, neither,”
he went on, in a sort of burst. “She’s no call
to make a to-do because she’s going to be quit
of him at last. She took him because she couldn’t
for shame do owt else, and a bonny time he’s
had wi’ her and her ways! What, it’s been the
talk o’ the country-side, the life she’s led the
poor old chap! Coming away from her’ll be
like coming out o’ hell. Ay, she’s been bad to
him, has Marget—she has that! She never let
him play his fiddle or owt, and give him the
back of her tongue from morn to night. Such a
rare hand as he used to be wi’ the fiddle an’ all!
There’s folks still ax after Fiddlin’ Kit.”</p>

<p>“Ay, well, poor old body, he’ll get nobody’s
tongue here; and he can have his precious
fiddle to bed and board. He can play till all’s
black if he likes, and owt he likes—fiddle or
toothcomb or big brass pan!”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” Thomas nodded. “That’s a
good lass,” but she turned away almost brusquely
and without a smile. “We mun do our best<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
for the old folks, I’m sure,” she went on. “One
o’ these days we’ll want seeing to ourselves.”
She began to move about the table again, but
with downcast eyes. “I’m rarely glad to have
him, and that’s the truth.”</p>

<p>“Ay, an’ he’s suited as sheep in a turmut-field
to come! Fair blubbered he did, the poor
old chap, when it was fixed. I reckon he’d near
give up hoping it would ever come off. Told
me he couldn’t sleep for thinking on’t, he did
that!”</p>

<p>Tears came into his wife’s eyes, so that the
pots in front of her melted into a shining blur.
“Ay, well, he’ll sleep right enough to-night,
I’ll take my oath! I’ve made him a grand bed,
wi’ a piller as soft as soft, and a bit of a rug
alongside for his poor feet. Rarely snod an’
heartsome the room looks, to be sure. You’d
best slip up and take a peep for yourself.”</p>

<p>He cast a glance at the new white-faced clock,
which the uncertain old grandfather was trying
to talk down. “Happen I’ll have a look after
I’ve gitten back. I’ll likely miss the trap if I
gang now. Any road, mind and see you hap
him up warm. He’s shivered many a time at
Marget’s, I’ll be bound!”</p>

<p>“There’s plenty blankets on the bed, and I’ve
put him yon quilt as we bought at Wilson’s
sale. It’s as good a quilt as ever I see. I mind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
Maggie Wilson making it herself. As for t’
blankets, they’re the best there is in t’house.”</p>

<p>“Ay, ay,” Thomas nodded, “hap him up.
Give him the best we’ve got, and you’ll not be
wrong.”</p>

<p>“I’d think shame o’ myself to give a visitor
owt else.” There was a stress in her voice that
made him turn his head, but she was going
away from him into the scullery and he could
not see her face. Her last words, however, were
flung back with the crisp cheerfulness to which
he was used. “I’ll be getting they scones
buttered while you’re off.... Now don’t be
mooning about and miss your time!”</p>

<p>She disappeared through the open door, and
he was left to his vigil over the marsh. His
mind, released from the tie of another in the
room, began slowly and toilsomely to go back
over old events. Once he sighed sharply, as if
oppressed, but it was simply with extraordinary
relief. He knew now, from his sudden sense of
mental ease, how he had worried and fretted
about the old dad. It was as if something he
had ignored had been tugging at his coat, and
now he could look behind him without fear of
what he might see. He was free, or thought
himself free, of that troubling episode at his
back ... yet wondered ever so vaguely why
there should still be a sore place at his heart.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
It was not as if he regretted anything he had
done, or that he would not have been ready to
do that particular thing again. There had been
only one way for him, and he had taken it,
and if it had happened a thousand times he
would have taken it still, but nevertheless it
had left him with a latent fear of life, a darkening
sense of indebtedness to fate. Even now, with
the whole business right at last, and the road
clear as the stars before his feet, he suffered a
faint oppression of the mind. He supposed he
would always have a bitter memory of the breaking
up of the old home. Even an outsider must
have felt it to some extent, an outsider who had
had nothing to do with the cause. The old
man had taken it so hard and yet with scarcely a
word, so painfully like a hurt but yielding child;
and he himself had done nothing but stand by,
because just at that time he had not been able
to help.... When he came to that word
“able,” it somehow stuck in his throat....
Anyhow, able or no, he had not helped, that
was sure; and so the old man and the home
had had to go....</p>

<p>That was after his mother’s death, of course,
and after his eldest brother’s death, too; not
that matters had ever been very grand at
Beautiful End. Kit had never been a practical
man at any time of his life, had never known<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
the substance from the shadow or the business
from the dream. He would be off playing his
fiddle while crops waited and stock starved.
Not but what he had played it rarely—everybody
admitted that. There was not one of his
sons but was proud of his gift, however awkward
the moment of demonstration and the certainty
of its cost. Even among themselves they
allowed no criticism of his method of life, and
certainly they never allowed it from anybody
else. They had the strong filial feeling natural
to their breed, and, added to that, a vague
sense of something helpless and wonderful
entrusted to their care. Lacking the gift on
their own account, they yet shared an artistic
strain which bade them pay tribute to the
glamour, and worship, if they could not follow,
the gleam. They had no quarrel with music
if there was also daily bread. It was only that
farming and suchlike didn’t agree.</p>

<p>Perhaps things might have been better if Kit
had gone to a new spot instead of following his
father on the farm where he was bred. For
once, in the shock of change, he might have seen
both place and life in a practical light, and
begun, at least, on normal, practical lines. But
on the marsh, where he had dreamed as a lad,
and which he had never left, he had never
had even the vestige of a chance. For him it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
was saturated with wonderment, tuned to the
first magic of his fiddle, set in the light that
never was on sea or land. It was impossible
for him to reduce his particular enchantment
to sound commercial terms. The place wasn’t
even real to him in the sense that it was real to
others. It was the land of faery, and he had
never come out of that land until—well, if the
truth were known, he had never really come
out. Spiritually, he had gone on living as he
had lived as a youth. Life had not altered for
him even when he succeeded to the farm, except
that the rent which had stood in his father’s
name now stood in his own.</p>

<p>Not that Thomas, brooding as he watched,
worked things out for himself like this. He only
said to himself that his father, when he was
young, might have done better with a bit of
stirring up. It was right enough for a man to
come back to his own place, as he himself had
done, but it did him no harm to have a look at
other methods first. Rooted and grooved in a
spot, he might never grow up, and so throw the
whole chain of existence out of gear. This
bother, for instance, of the last few years—why,
it should never have been allowed to
happen at all. If Kit could have framed a little
better at his job ... if he could have hung on a
bit longer ... made a little brass ... but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
where was the use of thinking about that now?
Farther than this little mental growl, Thomas
neither argued nor blamed. He accepted his
father and his doings as he had accepted them
all his life, and traced the shadow that lay on
the evening’s joy no further than himself.</p>

<p>The three sons had been dark, silent men,
caring for little beyond their work and the
ordinary pastimes of their class. They had
been cradled in music, but, as Thomas said, its
only expression through them was in their heels.
They were all good dancers, and had been
known as such far and near, appearing at every
gathering with their serious faces and light feet.
They were wrestlers as well, though here Bob
was easily first, just as in the dancing Thomas
was easily first. John might have been better
than either, but he had not tried or not cared.
Both the younger sons had gone out to service
as lads, while John stayed to help his father at
home. John had never married, never gone
away to stay, never moved one day out of the
groove into which he had been born. He had
worked hard, but without zest, and in his work
had kept to the old ways, instead of moving
with the times. It was almost as if he had known
his life would end at thirty-eight, and so the
travail of progress had not seemed to him worth
while. He never talked of the future as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
others did when they met, even unlucky Bob,
with all the weights he had made such haste to
fasten about his neck. Thomas remembered
him moving alone about the level fields, a
melancholy figure in spite of his youth and
strength. He had been most at home with the
stock, friends, whose lives, like his own, were
ruled from without and had but a little day.
But as long as he lived he had kept things going
on the farm, just as his mother had kept things
going in the house. And then, just over two
years ago, the pair of them had died within a
month; he, of a slipping ladder on a stack;
she, in the new-established order of change.
Shortly after had come the final change of all,
when the living had followed the dead from out
the house.</p>

<p>John had been only a negative sort of success,
but Bob had been a failure all along the line.
He had not liked his first situation from the
start, and it was not long before the situation
ceased to care about him. He had taken to
changing places very soon, and, as is usually
the case, the changes were mostly towards a
lower grade. Marriage had anchored him, after
a fashion, but at the same time it had finished
his chance of ever rising higher. He now lived
in the village across the marsh, acting as odd-job
man to a cattle dealer in the place. His<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
cottage was an abode of tempest and wrath,
slatternly beyond belief, full of crawling and
screaming children and the loud alarums of a
nagging woman’s voice. It was easy to see
where Bob would probably end, with a public-house
almost cheek by jowl with his own. And
yet, as Agnes had just said, he had been a smart
enough lad....</p>

<p>Thomas, indeed, was the only one who had
made out, unless John’s translation from a workaday
world might be counted a higher achievement
still. At his first hiring he had found for
himself a rare good spot, and had stayed there
solidly all through. Bob’s flights of fancy in
the way of new jobs did not appeal to his
farther-seeing mind; never, indeed, stirred him
to anything but a sort of wondering contempt.
He knew what he wanted, and, once set upon
the course that led to it direct, could not be
forced from it or lured aside. He had his
settled programme of life long before it came
anywhere within his reach. He would save
enough brass to start comfortably on his own;
he would take a farm on the marsh, and he would
marry Agnes Black. But he was thirty-five
before any of these things came to pass.</p>

<p>Yet, up to the last few years, he had had no
doubt about them at all. They would follow,
he thought, as naturally as harvest followed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
seed-time or summer fulfilled spring. Nature’s
checks to the plans of man had, as a rule, some
form of logic at their back, and were generally
rectified in Nature’s time. Checks in his own
scheme, if they came, would follow the same
lines, and his practised country patience would
be able to see them through. And then suddenly
and with lasting amazement he discovered that
life was not like that—that it was more complicated
and subtle than Nature, more idiotic,
incomprehensible and perverse. It threw things
awry without purpose or natural law, wrecked,
and did not renew, robbed, and did not repay.
His way had been blocked, as if by logs piling
terribly in a stream, and there had been nothing
for it but to hack himself out.</p>

<p>Two years ago he had been just two years
behind his plans. His savings were not yet
quite full-grown, his wife was still to secure.
Not but what things were more or less fixed
between Agnes and himself, and had been,
indeed, for long. It had been a kindly courting,
too, with never a quarrel of any sort to break
its charm, and scarcely a casual look or impatient
word. Most certainly it had not resembled in
any degree the cat-and-mouse exhibition presented
by Marget and Bob. He had never
imagined that they might slip apart until the
thing was on the point of coming about, still<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
less ever dreamed that they might do so with
the end of the road actually in sight. Nevertheless,
when the changes had begun with a
rush, the first of them had announced itself just
here. Suddenly she had turned from him, half
hesitating, it was true, but turning away from
him, all the same. She was not certain, she said,
that she could marry him, after all, and it was
better to think now than on the other side of
the ring. She had no reason to give except
that she wasn’t sure, and all his wrath and persuasion
could not change her mind. He was
free to leave her, she told him, if he thought it
best, or welcome to wait for the puzzle to come
right. He had chosen to wait, if the impossibility
of doing anything else might be dignified
by the name of choice. Sometimes it seemed
to him that they had already waited too long,
but he was unable to tear himself from his
settled course. Months of bewildered argument
and rage brought him no nearer the solution of
the point. Perhaps, after all, they had not
been suited, in spite of the pleasant years.
Perhaps it was just that the sight of the end,
which sent him pressing on, had startled her to
a halt and a springing aside.</p>

<p>Thomas, for whom nothing had ever gone
amiss, found it hard to believe that fate was
really playing him false. His disgust, when the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
truth was finally forced upon him, was that of
a man seeing for the first time the other side of
the shield. The trouble and dread of his threatened
loss had all the freshness of first pain and
dread. It seemed to him that, if he lost Agnes,
everything else in his scheme of life might
possibly go as well; and while he was passing
through this uncertain time, trying hard to
regain his old security of belief, the trouble at
home threatened afresh the ground beneath his
feet.</p>

<p>He had been fond of his mother, and was
shaken by her loss, and he was hit, as well, by
his brother’s accident and death, yet neither
calamity seemed for the moment to threaten
either his future or his present way of life.
Yet he must have known what would happen if
his thoughts had not been entirely fixed elsewhere.
Kit had muddled along for a while
with the help of a hired man, and then one night
he sent for his two remaining sons.</p>

<p>Standing there in the caressing sun, with
achievement behind him and the crown of
achievement before, Thomas looked back on
the long walk in the rain, the dull sands and the
grey and sodden marsh. Under the waning
light and the veil of the wet they had looked
all one, all an untouched waste, unclaimed of
any but the sea. And to-night even the sea<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
seemed to refuse a thing so desolate and bare,
leaving it lying as if accursed between heaving
water and the richer land. The younger brother,
tramping the dyked road, had come upon Bob,
slouching slowly ahead, a dreary figure still
drearier than the day. The farm, when it stood
up to them on the flat, looked lonely and helpless
beyond words, a lost and futile thing of no
account. They could have sworn that it was
empty and that no one moved in the rooms,
either human or ghost; that neither chair nor
bed nor old press held a trace of souls that were
gone. Only those who loved it would not mock
at its name to-night. But as they came nearer
by degrees, and its blank face took something
of meaning and shape, they heard the thin voice
of a violin.</p>

<p>They had stopped, he and Bob, by the
meadow-gate, and listened awhile to the trembling
sweetness charming the sad marsh. It
had seemed the smallest thing in the world
between the vastness of earth and sky, and
perhaps also the bravest thing in the world as
well. They had forgotten for a moment how
the rain was beating over the fence. They had
forgotten the untended fields and neglected
home. They had even forgotten the probable
errand on which they were bent, the oppression
of which had clogged their feet as they came.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
They remembered together little things out of
the past ... a wooden cradle with carved sides
... apples in the orchard ... long paddles on
warm sands ... skating ... the red light of
a hearth ... an aproned form with a face that
was always looking out, set for them at every
window, watching for them at each door. Every
picture they saw was bathed in sun or fire,
because the notes of the fiddle were touching it
with gold. Thomas forgot while he listened that
life was twisting itself into knots in his helpless
hands. Out there, while the fiddle spoke, Agnes
still loved him and had never looked aside. And
perhaps Bob, too, found an old dream waiting
on the desolate road.</p>

<p>The life of the house seemed to sink when the
fiddle stopped, and as they came towards it
across the field with heavy, squelching steps, it
had the effect of retreating instead of drawing
near. Even when the door opened at the click
of the garden gate, showing their father’s figure
in the square, the impression was that of a
shadow opening in a shadow’s face. They had
gone in silently, their mood gentled by that
singing voice over the marsh, and the door
closing behind them had shut out the rain but
nothing else. The dusk and sadness claiming
both land and sea were all through the lost
farmhouse as well.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span></p>

<p>The three of them sat in the kitchen without
fire or light, and the younger men said nothing
while the old man put his case. They stared
at him dumbly in the dusky place, seeing little
through the gloom but the silver of hair and
whisker round his head, and hearing his voice,
when they looked away, as if it came from nobody
at all, the vibrating old voice that had
mostly been used for greeting and song and
seemed to have borrowed a sweetness from the
violin. There were only the three of them in
the shadowed room, but it always seemed possible
that there might be more. Sometimes,
indeed, Thomas forgot that John was no longer
there, and strained his eyes towards the corners
to make sure. He had always been so still and
rare of speech that death did not seem to have
taken him away. Afterwards, it seemed to
Thomas that many had sat in judgment on the
case, for shame can multiply a face or two
into a crowd. The wettest moon he had ever
seen had suddenly appeared at a pane, like a
stranger walking and staring round the house;
and where the waves were breaking below the
farmyard wall was the dismal wash of a rain-whipped,
lifeless tide.</p>

<p>Old Christopher Sill had not beaten about the
bush; indeed, he was disconcertingly direct.
He told them quite simply that he had had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
notice to quit, making no attempt at either
excuse or complaint. Both, of course, had
guessed that the end was getting near, but it
came as a shock when finally declared. The
thing was common enough, indeed, in such lives
as theirs, but it had not happened to the Sills
for more than a hundred years. They had just
gone on, father and son, until they chanced to
come to Kit, and, if John had lived, he might
very possibly have gone on, too. They had
often wondered, Thomas and Bob, why he had
never pressed his father to resign, but they
guessed at the double reason now. John’s feet
had long been set on a different road, and the
money behind the farm had been dwindling every
year. Money vanished with Kit as the notes of
his fiddle fluted out to sea, and he troubled as
little about it as about the music-gold that he
could so easily recreate. The steady downgrade
on which he had lived had not been able
to push the lesson home. It had never seemed
possible that he could leave the farm, and the
bare formality of a notice to quit could not
make it possible now. Surely there could be
nothing more right than that a man should
spend his last breath where he was born, and
especially one of the rooted, marsh-bred Sills?
He only asked for a year or two at the end of
all that had gone; couldn’t Thomas and Bob<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
see that he had that? A year or two, happen—and
happen not so much. He wouldn’t be
long at his dying, he felt sure.</p>

<p>“But ye’ve gitten your notice,” Bob observed,
staring at the floor, and Thomas had looked out
of the window at the sky. Neither needed telling
what was coming next, and each was getting
ready to meet it in his way.... All those
generations of Sills had kept Kit on the place
long after a less tie-bound landlord would have
turned him out, and they gave him a further
chance of rescue now. The Squire was willing
to let the farm to one of the lads, provided he
could show a reasonable guarantee. “Then
happen you’d let me bide wi’ ye till I was
finished,” Kit said at the end. “I partly what
think it wouldn’t be so long.”</p>

<p>Even in the dusk, and doggedly turned away,
they had been conscious of his eyes, moving
enquiringly from face to face. Both of them,
staring either at the sky or at the floor, saw
equally the gleam of the white head turning and
pausing and always turning again. In the house,
in spite of its dumb ghosts, there was still the
strange emptiness that stays so long after a
death, as if out of a full cup some portion has
been spilled. The silence enfolding the brothers
seemed to beg to speak for itself, to deplore and
refuse the harsh necessity of words. But still<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
the old man’s eyes travelled and begged; and
at last the slack-shouldered elder moved his
head in a dreary shake.</p>

<p>“I’m no use to you that way, Father, I doubt,”
Bob said. “What this place wants is brass,
and I’ve none o’ that at my back. It takes me
all my time and more to shift along as it is, as
folks in plenty’ll tell you if you ax. It’s no
manner o’ use my thinking o’ the farm.”</p>

<p>There was a second pause after that, and with
it a sense in the air that the question had passed
on, but nobody answered it except by that
silence which resisted and refused. Then Bob
spoke again, with a sort of half-shamed urging
in his tone. “The lad here mun ha’ saved a bit
by now. Happen Thomas could see to help you
out.”</p>

<p>Undoubtedly Thomas had seemed the one to
help—the youngest, the strongest, and the man
who had the brass. It was well enough known
that he had saved, had been careful and patient,
anxious to lay by. They knew, too, that he
meant to take a farm, and here was Beautiful
End for the lifting of a hand. What could he
possibly want that would be more likely than
that? Bob, who could as well have taken the
Hall itself as the little farm, envied his younger
brother with all his heart. It was on Thomas
the old man had relied, never on Bob; that was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
perfectly clear to the one who had not made
out. The asking of them together had been
only a form, a polite concession to conservative
family dues. Thomas was the right and proper
person to respond; to put it plainly, he was
the only one who could. But the claim on his
help had come at the worst possible time, and
his natural kindly instinct smothered in revolt.</p>

<p>“Not but I doubt Marget would never ha’
come,” Bob was drawling on in his tired voice.
“There’s over much work on a farm to suit her
by a deal. I reckon she’d ha’ thought it a dreary
spot an’ all. She’s one as likes seeing folks go
by, and a sight o’ clattin’ an’ suchlike in the
street. But the lad here isn’t bothered wi’ a
missis just yet, nor like to be, as far as we know.
There’s nowt to keep him from throwing up his
job. He’s free to do as suits him, is Tom.”</p>

<p>And still Thomas did not speak, ashamed of
himself and yet holding himself hard. The
aversion with which he had set out to meet this
probable demand arose in him again in a fierce
flood and all but forced him to his feet. It was
a wet night, or he might never have come at
all, but on an evening like this Agnes would
be sure to be fast at home. There would be no
chance of meeting her about the fields or lanes.
He could never have brought himself to come
so far, while the hope of her face was behind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
each turn and hedge.... Yet here he was
being asked to leave the spot for good—he,
whose uncertainty could not stay one hour!</p>

<p>Suddenly he spoke, without preamble or excuse,
long after the question seemed to have fainted
away and died, ashamed. “I’m no use, neither,”
he heard himself saying at last, his voice sounding
dull and cold over the wrath and shame
within. He was still staining at the sky while
he spoke. Failure may look at the floor because
of the burden on its back, but success, when it
makes its refusal, must look up. It was then
that the moon slid round the corner, and drew
nearer, and looked in. He felt a spasm of rage
against it, as at another spectator of the ignoble
scene.</p>

<p>“Ay, but you’ve the brass saved all right!”
Bob exclaimed, twisting his head to get a glimpse
of his brother’s face. His discomfort at his own
position in the affair seemed for the moment
to be swallowed up in surprise. “Many’s the
time you’ve tellt me on’t, I’ sure, and how you
meant taking a farm afore so long. I’d ha’
thought this had fallen in for you just right.”</p>

<p>“I’m not ready,” Thomas said doggedly. “I
mun have a bit more time. Happen another
year I could see my way....”</p>

<p>“A year’s neither here nor there, surely, if
yon’s all?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span></p>

<p>“It’d be two, happen—ay, and maybe more.
I don’t rightly know. I can’t rightly say.”</p>

<p>“Ay, well, it’s now or never for the old dad,”
Bob said. “A year or two’s no use to the old
chap, wi’ notice to quit pinned to his jacket-tail.
What’s gitten you, lad, to be hanging
back like this?” He raised his voice and spoke
more firmly, sure of his cause. “The spot’ll
suit you, waint it, come to that?”</p>

<p>“Ay, I’d like it right well.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, whatever’s to do?” Bob peered
at him curiously, struck by the mixture of
longing and dogged resistance in his tone. “If
it’s nobbut a matter of a pound or two, you can
fetch up easy enough on yon. There’s a deal
o’ folk’d lend you a hand, seeing how you’re
placed. It’s more than time, too, you were
starting on your own. It doesn’t do to stop in
service over long. You get kind o’ fixed and
feared o’ striking out.”</p>

<p>“I’ll strike right enough, never you fret—I
will that. But it’ll be in my own time....”</p>

<p>“You can’t always suit things just to the
tick.... Eh, I wish the chance had come my
road, that’s all!” Bob sighed and frowned,
depressed by the thought of what he had missed,
and the folly which refused what he would so
gladly have seized. “But it’s no use my thinking
on’t, so that’s flat. Even if I could borrow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
the brass, I’d never catch up with it, I doubt,
and there’s Marget to be suited in t’matter, as
I said afore. Nay, I’m a broken reed, that’s
what it is, and I mun just let be. It’s for you
to say what you’ll do for the old man.”</p>

<p>“I can’t do owt—yet,” Thomas repeated.
“I mun ha’ time....” and pushed his chair
further into the concealing gloom. He felt
trapped in a cunning snare, all the more cunning
and cruel because it was simply his own plan of
life twisted and tangled out of shape. He had
never dreamed that his future hung by a hair,
but then he had never imagined that John
might die, or that Agnes might so incredibly
change her mind. He felt not only trapped
but mocked, and the mockery hardened him in
his resolve. Difficult as he was to turn, he
might yet have been driven to yield, if the whole
business had not worn so ironic a leer. The
rough hand of fate was thrust in among his
careful plans. His faithfulness and self-denial,
his patience and hard work, were all to be
shuffled and risked in a hurried moment like this.</p>

<p>If only things had been right between him
and his lass, how triumphantly simple the whole
problem would have been! It was true that he
would have liked another year to look round,
but he would have let that go without hesitation
for the chance of the farm. The place was in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
bad state, of course, but that should mean an
easier rental, and all the more credit to him
when he pulled it round. He knew the little
farm by stick and stone, and loved it well
enough, too. He was content enough in his
hired spot, but the marsh blood that was in
him cried always to be settled within sight and
sound of the sea. Even to-night, though his
heart was pulling him back, and the marsh was
a dripping waste with a trap at the farther end,
he had drawn great breaths as the mountains
dropped behind. To have had the old home
with Agnes—why, it was better by far than he
had planned! And in the event, as it had
proved, how far it had fallen short!</p>

<p>He would have been glad, too, to keep the
old man, just as the Agnes he had counted as
his would also have been glad. Both had been
bred to the sense of duty powerful in their class,
and the fact that Kit had muddled his own
chance would have made no difference to that
duty in their eyes. He would have been welcome
to their home as long as he lived, and indeed,
there would have been no hardship about it,
after all, for he was both lovable and kind, as
well as the sort that made little trouble about
the house. Thomas, in fact, would have been
proud as well as glad to give him what he asked.
He would have liked to have seen him daily<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
in his chair, playing his fiddle in a patch of
shade or pottering about the garden in the sun.
The old man had always been rarely fond of
flowers, and no matter what happened or did
not happen on the farm, the garden, at least,
was always bright and sweet. Flowers seemed
to grow for him, indeed, under the mere caressing
glance of his eye.... But at present Agnes
was turned the other way, and he would not
travel a road that was not hers as well. As long
as he could he would stay within reach, doggedly
waiting and waiting for the recoil, and if anything
else called for his help, he must shut his ears
and let it go to the wall. A few miles over the
hill would have made little difference, perhaps,
but he could not have endured those miles,
and he did not mean to try. Without Agnes,
he would let the farm go without even raising
his hand. Without Agnes, he would let his
father go, too.</p>

<p>There being little else he could do for the old
man, Bob was roused to fight for him to the
last. It was his brother’s duty, he pointed out,
a duty that would have been a pleasure to other
folks, not so far. Nobody could have had a
better father, as they knew right well, and he
was entitled to the little they could do. It
wasn’t as if Thomas hadn’t the brass—what,
he had more than once told them about it himself!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
If that was true—and it was like enough,
after all these years—there could be nothing and
less than nothing in the way. Supposing it did
mean a year before he’d planned, why, surely
to goodness there was no hitch in that? He’d
never for shame let his father be turned out,
like a come-day-go-day tenant that never meant
to stop? He could have both bed and bite
under his roof, Bob said, but it wouldn’t be
much to crack on, after Beautiful End. There
was only one right road, as anybody could see,
and that was to put in at once for the offered
farm.</p>

<p>Kit never spoke or stirred while Bob argued
and Thomas denied, the deep, slow voices rising
a little towards the end, but never once growing
bitter or unkind. Abuse and bickering had
always been strangers under that roof, and even
Thomas’s sullen rage did not vent itself in speech.
He spoke seldom, indeed, as seldom as he could,
and then only dour refusals to consider the
matter at all, retreating further and further out
of the path of the moon. But throughout the
whole scene Kit never said another word, and
his sons did not think it strange. He was of
the sort that makes its appeal and then stands
aside, leaving others to argue and settle its
fate. He had pleaded his case with a childlike
certainty that somebody would step in, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
the matter was fought to an end without his
help. Even when Thomas had said nay for the
last time—the hundredth, miserable, degrading
time, so it seemed—his father had not spoken
again. Perhaps even then he hoped and had
faith, that faith in chance which dreamers carry
to their graves; or perhaps he guessed the hold
of the tie to which Thomas would give no name.</p>

<p>“Ay, well, happen you’ll sleep on’t,” Bob
had said, rising at last, and speaking even to
the end as if his father were not there. “There’s
nowt else I can think on as’ll likely change your
mind, and I doubt I’d ha’ been wiser not to say
so much. But it’s hard to stand by when you
can’t do nowt to help, and see as others as can
all right but happen won’t. There’s a home for
the old man at our house whenever he likes to
come, and right welcome he’ll be under any
roof of mine. As for Marget, she’ll likely kick
a bit at first, but I’ll get her round to it after a
deal o’ talk. She’ll come to it all right, same as
other folks have done, and it’s queer if I can’t
give my father a share of my own spot.”</p>

<p>“I’ll lend a hand wi’ the keep,” Thomas muttered,
out of the dark, and Bob nodded in answer,
turning to the door. He knew well enough what
his offer of a home was worth, among weakly,
ill-tempered children and under a nagging shrew.
He knew as well as Thomas or Kit that it would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
only be a dismal waiting-place for death. It
was bad enough to have to quit, to break ties
and begin a feeble life again, to lose the sound
of the tide awash at the sea-wall, but the worst
to come was not the loss of the farm. It was
Marget that was the dreadful thing to face, as
they were all aware. It was the thought of
Marget with the old man in her hands that
almost defeated Thomas at the last. If only
the poor old chap could have gone to somebody
else!... “Now ye’ll mind ye can come to
us, Father!” Bob repeated on the step, and Kit
had simply thanked him and said no more. In
the porch, Thomas, dismal as the night, managed
to drag out a few ungracious words. “As soon
as I’ve gitten things straight, Father ... just
hold on....” And Kit had said thank you
quite simply for that, too.</p>

<p>Once outside he was seized by a passionate
impulse to return. Grasping at one thing still
out of reach, he was more than probably risking
the loss of all. Supposing Agnes should never
be won back, no matter what he offered or threw
away? It was on the cards, as he was forced
to admit. Even without her he would still have
the farm, and his payment of satisfaction in
his father’s face. But, rough and unthinking as
he was, he guessed that partial fulfilment was
more to be dreaded than complete loss, that a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
heart’s desire is better rejected if it cannot be
had whole. And indeed, this strife with himself
was only a waste of energy, after all. He knew,
as things stood, he would never come away.</p>

<p>The brothers found nothing more to say as
they followed the muddy track to the meadow
gate. Bob had tried his eloquence, such as it
was, to a hopeless end, and his own position
was doubtful, to say the least. At any moment
Thomas might have turned, and with just cause.
He was the youngest after all, and the only one
that had stood on his own feet. John had not
had enough courage even to live, and Bob,
beaten and slack, was scarcely the one to preach
burdens on to another’s back. He was tired,
too, after a wearing day and a scream-riddled
night; busy, moreover, with the problem of
facing Marget with the news.</p>

<p>At the back of his mind was a vague idea that
Thomas’s wooing was somehow going amiss.
He had thought of it while he argued in the house,
but Thomas had never thought fit to mention
the lass, and it wasn’t his brother’s place to
bring her in. The courting, he knew, had
been a long one, like his own. He could have
told Thomas a thing or two, he felt sure, only
telling these things was never any use. In spite
of his good sense and superior luck, Thomas
must dree his weird like the rest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span></p>

<p>They had parted where the roads parted on
the marsh, and after them through the lifting
curtain of the rain had looked the pale
wraith that wanted to be the moon. And again,
over their heads from the lone farm, now slipped
away into the unbordered dark, there trembled
the long flight of the violin.</p>

<p>Alone on the marsh, Thomas had once again
nearly repented and turned back. It was not
that the fiddle seemed to call him back. It had,
on the contrary, the effect of shutting him out.
It seemed to mark the final detachment of father
from son, to emphasise the division of two who
by rights should have held together, but were
nevertheless going to drift apart. It was Kit’s
swan-song to his own place, and as such it kept
its ecstasy for himself and its poignancy for the
listener on the waste. Thomas had an idea
that he was hurrying back to the farm, plodding
again through the meadow along the rutted
track. He heard the little click of the garden
gate, saw himself pushing gently at the door,
met the sweet flood of music rushing out, and
warmed to the old man’s welcome and relief.
But always his feet were taking him away, and
the pull of the farm and its trouble lessened
with every mile. Now his thoughts reached
forward rather than behind, fixed on a dweller
in another house. In his mind he saw her home<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
between gentle curves of the land, the night
brooding over its walls that seemed as much
grown out of the earth as the hedgerows
in the fields. He saw the syringa over the
porch lifting its star-faces to the moon. He
saw faint candle-light in a room upstairs,
and herself a moving shadow across the
blind....</p>

<p>He was late at his own place, and found himself
locked out, but even as he tried the door
he heard stumbling on the stairs, and knew that
his step had warned the folk across the yard.
While he waited he said to himself that if there
was any bother he would give in his notice right
away. It only wanted some little thing like
that to fix his mind. He tried to work himself
into a fiercer mood, ready to lash out at the
first suggestion of rebuke. It would be grand
to be his own master after so long, instead of a
hired man at beck and call. With a word he
could alter the position when he liked. But
when the bolts were unshot the farmer said
nothing except that it was a dirty night, and
Thomas took off his boots in silence and followed
him upstairs. In the morning the porridge was
badly burnt, and again he tried to drive himself
to a break, but once again something put him
off and he kept still. That evening, however,
he met Agnes in the lane between the farm and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
her home, and the thing rose in him with a rush
and he spoke out.</p>

<p>“You can take it or leave it, as suits you,”
he said, “but there it be to your hand. The
farm’s ready and waiting on you, and so’s the
man. I’ve had enough o’ your putting off and
keeping me hanging round. You’ve got to fix
it up now or let me gang.”</p>

<p>“You must give me time,” she answered,
using his own words of the night before. “I’m
not ready—I don’t know my mind. As for
keeping you hanging round, you’ve been free
to go this many a long day, as you know right
well. I’m not that anxious to get wed, not I.
But if it’s me you’re wanting, as you seem to
think, well, there’s nothing for it but to give me
time.”</p>

<p>“You’ve had time and plenty, I’m sure!” he
retorted with rough scorn. “Time to look
round at all the lads and begin again. Time to
look round at the married folk an’ all, and see
who’s suited and who baint. But there’s got to
be an end of your daft shilly-shally now. Seems
to me you think it’s nobbut a game.”</p>

<p>“Nay, then, that’s just what I don’t!” she
flashed back in wrath. “It’s because I take it
so serious-like that I don’t mean to be pushed.
There’s times it seems to me that serious I don’t
know how folk ever come to it at all. ’Tisn’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
as if it was just a bit of a bargain over a cow or
a two-three sheep. It’s you and me beginning
our lives right over again from the start, and
maybe both on us finding we’re different folk from
what we thought. I’m suited well enough as I
am, and I’d be a fool not to stop and think.
I’ll not wed till I’m that set on the lad I’ll find
myself fair running to kirk, and I’m a long way
off yet from being as nicked in the head as
yon! I don’t say but what I think a deal of
you, because I do. I’m not breaking my
heart over you, that’s all. If you want
to gang, you can gang, ay, and right off the
reel, but I won’t stir finger or foot until I
choose!”</p>

<p>“Ay, but there’s the old man, I tell ye!”
Thomas had blurted out. “I’m in a cleft stick,
seemingly, atween you and him. They’ll turn
him out of his spot if I waint promise to take
hold.”</p>

<p>“Eh, now, if that isn’t terble hard!” She
fell silent, thinking after her passionate speech,
studying his lowering, fretted face, and seeing
all in a moment how they stood. “But there’s
never two minds about it, surely?” she added,
in a troubled voice. “You’ll have to see to
your father one way or t’other, you and Bob.
And you’ll never to goodness miss the chance
o’ the farm?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span></p>

<p>He turned his eyes on her with their dogged,
miserable look.</p>

<p>“Ay, but I will, if I can’t have you an’ all.”</p>

<p>“You’ve had your answer to that till I’m
fair tired.” She turned away from him, staring
vexedly at the hedge.</p>

<p>“Ay, well, then, that’s all there is to it, I
reckon. Father and farm’ll have to see to
themselves.”</p>

<p>“You can have a housekeeper to do for you,”
Agnes said.</p>

<p>“An’ a bonny makeshift an’ all, for a man as
wants a wife!”</p>

<p>“Other folks do with them all right.”</p>

<p>“Well, I want nowt wi’ ’em, so that’s flat.”</p>

<p>“But you’ll have to do summat o’ the sort,”
she protested angrily, troubled and also afraid.
Her own particular cleft stick was becoming
plainer with every minute that passed. “You’ll
have to have somebody about the place, and
it’s fair wicked to talk o’ missing the farm.
What, you’ve been wanting a spot of your own
for long enough, I’m sure, and now you can do
what’s right by your dad at the same time.”</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t ha’ minded him about the
house? If things was fixed, I’m meaning ...
if we were wed....”</p>

<p>“Mind an old body settin’ on the hearth?”
She turned to face him again with wonder in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
her eyes. “Nay, but you know me better than
that by a deal! I’d ha’ been glad enough to
see to him, that I would. I’ve always been
rarely fond o’ Fiddlin’ Kit.”</p>

<p>“Ay, well, then,” Thomas insisted, “what’s in
the road?”</p>

<p>“I’ve tell’t you what’s in the road. I can’t
frame to make up my mind.”</p>

<p>“Seems to me it’s an easy enough job,” he
answered her gloomily, staring at his feet, and
she laughed in spite of her anger and dismay.</p>

<p>“Happen it is for some folk, but not me....
Hark ye! Show a bit o’ sense, do now,” she
coaxed. “You go off to your farm, and likely
I’ll throw my shoe after you, even yet. I reckon
you’ll ha’ forgot all about me, by then.”</p>

<p>“’Tisn’t me as’ll do the forgetting!” he turned
on her fiercely, breaking out at last. “It’s your
sort, not mine, as doesn’t keep a friend in mind.
It’s your sort as goes back on your word, and
plays fast and loose and suchlike tricks. You’d
be glad to be shot of me, I’ll be bound, and afore
long there’d be somebody easier in my shoes,
but I don’t mean to give you a chance o’ forgetting,
don’t you fret! Am I like to put
miles between us when I’m lile or nowt to you
in the same lane? Nay, I’ll bide ... I’ll bide....
I’m used to your ways, and though I don’t
think much on ’em, I reckon I can see it through.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
But it isn’t only me as is waiting on you now.
You’re making me act bad to the old dad, and
that’s what’s putting me about.”</p>

<p>“It’s no business of mine, I tell you!” she
flung back, full of resentment at this shifting of
loads. “It’s nowt to do wi’ me, anyway
round.” They stood glaring at each other with
frowning faces and hard eyes, blaming each other
for the subtle net by which they were equally
entrapped. “I’ve no call to wed just to give
your father a home,” she went on. “I’m sorry
for him, as I said, and I’d lend a hand if I could,
but I don’t see as it’s fair to blame me because
I can’t. You’ve not overmuch pride, I doubt,
or you’d never put it like yon. It’s nobbut a
poor sort o’ lad as’d take me at the price!”</p>

<p>He threw her a final look of helpless rage,
and swung away from her, facing towards the
farm. “Then he mun gang to Marget,” he
flung over his shoulder, “Marget and Bob!”
and at the terrible name of Marget she cried
aloud. Thomas continued steadily on his way.</p>

<p>“Eh, Thomas, you don’t mean that!” she
called after his retreating back. “She’ll be bad
to him, will Marget—she’ll finish him right off.
Bide a bit, can’t you?... Save us, man, can’t
you bide? I never somehow thought of the old
man going there.”</p>

<p>“Where else should he gang?” he demanded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
sullenly, stopping but still turned away. “Bob’s
his own flesh and blood as well as me, and a
long sight the oldest on us an’ all. There’s
t’ Union, likely, might do for the old dad, but I
doubt they won’t take him while there’s others
to fill the job.”</p>

<p>“Nay, and why should it, I’d like to know!”
she exclaimed. “You should think shame o’
yourself for suchlike selfish talk.” There was
something desperate in her glance at the hedge
on either side, as if the fences were hung with
the net that would not let her through. From
them she looked once more at Thomas, turning
slowly on his heel, and slowly beginning at last
to see his way.... “I’d wed him myself and
work for him sooner than that!”</p>

<p>“I reckon there’s nowt agen you wedding
me instead.”</p>

<p>“Nay, then, I can’t.... I’ve tell’t you....
I just can’t.”</p>

<p>“Then he’ll be at Marget’s afore you can say
knife.”</p>

<p>They had changed places at last, as was clear
to both; in the course of a few moments they
had changed. At last he had found a way of
blocking her escape, of putting a log in the path
of her everlasting no. It was he who had the
better hold now, and he did not mean to be
stopped from winning the fall. He knew well<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
enough that however hard she might be with
a young man foolishly in love, she had the
softest heart in the world for the weak and old.
Perhaps he had no pride, as she said, but he
meant to use his father’s cause to the full for
the furthering of his own. He stood staring
fixedly at her downcast head, and the old kindliness
came back into his voice now that he saw
his advantage clear. He put the whole case
over to her again, but always with Marget looming
largely at the end, and had the same satisfaction
in the last effect. Agnes knew Bob’s
wife as well as anybody else, and needed no
enlightening as to her ways. His hopes rose
and his face cleared as he saw the position he
had cursed proving the door to his desire, and
as his heart eased he became more eloquent,
more tender, more difficult to resist. At the
finish he gave her a rough picture of the lonely
farm, and the fiddle singing into the night....</p>

<p>She yielded at last with wet eyes and a dismal
shake of her drooped head.</p>

<p>“Nay, then, we mun just put a stop to it,
that’s all. We can’t let him gang to Marget,
poor old chap! If you waint stir without me, I
mun wed you and take the risk, but I doubt
we’ll make a mess o’ things, you an’ me. It’s
nobbut a middlin’ sort of a bargain when folks
don’t both jump on the tick.” She looked up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
at him suddenly with a laugh that was more
than half a wail. “Eh, Thomas, but baint
there some other lass’d do as well?”</p>

<p>And then, when he had what he wanted, he
put it from him and turned away. As soon as
the battle was over, he saw at once the futility
of his success. He could think, now that he
was no longer vexed and opposed, and thinking,
could find nothing else to do but draw back.
His father could have only a few years in front
of him, after all, but this was for all his own life
and hers. He had his pride, in spite of her
taunt, and this was apparently where it stopped.
It was a poor bargain, as she had said, appealing
angrily to his common sense; a gift, if you
could call it a gift, that wouldn’t be even his
own. And it wasn’t much of a man who bullied
a woman into saying yes, who needed so mighty
a lever to get at her heart. He stood back once
again as she wept, and heard his voice sending
her away, heard himself seal his father into the
mercy of Bob’s wife....</p>

<p>So Kit had gone to Marget’s, trustful to the
end, even with his sold-up house behind him
and a shrewish face before. Thomas attended
the sale and bought in a few trifles at the old
man’s wish, and when all was over he borrowed
a trap and drove him away. Kit was cheerful
and talkative throughout the drive, and they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
never so much as mentioned Marget’s name.
Thomas had an insane idea that they would
find his mother at the farther end, and kept
seeing her waiting for them at the door. He
never forgot the journey’s real end, the shut
house full of eyes at every pane, the cold wait
in the empty street, the colder opening to let
them in. Marget had met them with silence at
first, and then with a gathering flood of angry
speech. Kit’s attempt at grateful thanks had
been swallowed up in it as the channels out on
the sands were swallowed by the winter wave.
Thomas waited until Marget’s breath gave out,
and then went away, feeling as though he had
thrown a live thing to a cat. After that time
he had gone as seldom as his sense of duty would
allow. He never failed, however, to pay his
share, and he managed to get news of the old
man from Bob. Not that Bob ever had a very
great deal to say, because he kept out of the
house as much as he could. The old man was
“ailing a bit,” or “right enough,” as the case
might be, but that was all. Now it was nearly
two years since Kit had gone to the unhappy
place—the place where a pair of lovers had
prisoned him in.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Agnes, returning, found him at the mirror
again, so intent that he started when she spoke.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span></p>

<p>“Land’s sake! Why, you’re not off yet!...
What’s come to you to be gaping in yon
glass?” She stared at him wonderingly, and
he turned a somewhat sheepish face. “You
nobbut look at it once a week, as a rule, and
that’s when you’re donning yourself for kirk.”</p>

<p>“I was nobbut taking a squint at the room,”
he answered in a puzzled tone. “Glass makes
it look different, I don’t know why.”</p>

<p>“Ay, I’ll be bound it’s different!” she exclaimed
with pride. “I’d a sight on’t once, not
long afore the sale, and a lost-looking, dismal
spot it was, to be sure! Seems like as if it
couldn’t possibly be the same. What wi’ new
furniture and range and wall-papers an’ suchlike,
it’s for all the world like some other place.”</p>

<p>“Ay, but I wasn’t meaning it like that.
Seems as if it was the <em>old</em> room I can see in
t’glass. It was the old kitchen glass, you’ll
think on, as I bought at the sale. Father didn’t
want it going to off-comers and suchlike, so I
bought it to please the poor old chap. He’d a
sort of idea as glasses knew a deal—said there
was glasses remembered things they’d seen.
Likely this here has got the old kitchen on its
mind. Likely it’s looked that often at the old,
it can’t frame yet to take a peep at the new.”</p>

<p>“Likely you’re blinded wi’ the sun!” She
flung him a look of laughing scorn and went to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
the window again.... “What in the name
o’ goodness can ha’ come to yon trap! D’you
think owt’s gone amiss on the road?”</p>

<p>“More like they’ve been late in setting off,
as I said afore. I’ll be bound Marget’s found
summat to keep ’em back, if it’s only to put
the poor old man about. Or likely they’ve been
bothered wi’ folk stopping ’em on t’road.
They’ll all be agog on the marsh to think as
he’s coming home.”</p>

<p>“Folks say they’re glad the Sills isn’t quitting
the marsh,” Agnes said. “They thought nowt
o’ the man as come here after your dad. He
seems to have been only a terble middlin’ sort—over
fond o’ the drink and happen a bit daft.
The place isn’t over lucky, Thomas, I doubt!”</p>

<p>“Folks make their own luck,” Thomas said
doggedly, squaring his jaw, “and anyway round
it’s brought me all the luck I want. There’s
you here, as I never thought’d come, and brass
enough to put the farm on its legs. And now
there’s the old man coming home to-night. I
reckon I’m suited as well as most. There’s
nobbut one thing grubs me,” he went on, with
a moody look, “and that’s that the old chap
ever had to gang.”</p>

<p>“Eh, let it bide, can’t you?” Agnes cried
aloud. She stole a glance at his face and her
own drooped again. “Surely to goodness you’ve<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
never been going over yon? Things is right
enough now—as right as rain.”</p>

<p>“Ay, but they’re spoilt a bit for us, all the
same.” His voice had dropped back into the
bitter tone. “I still feel sort o’ shamed about
the job, and I reckon you’re none so bright
about it yourself. And yet, if it come back
over again, I’d do same as afore.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see as we could ha’ done different,”
Agnes said, and sighed. “I did say as I’d
come if you couldn’t fix nowt else, but I doubt
we wouldn’t ha’ made much out in the end.”</p>

<p>“It’d ha’ been hell for both on us afore so
long.” He began to walk restlessly up and down
behind her back, the old angry resentment
blurring and troubling his face. “What beats
me about it all is what come over you just then.
You’d been right enough afore, and you’re
suited well enough now. What, for the land’s
sake made you act so strange?”</p>

<p>“Nay, I don’t know, I’m sure. I’m fair
puzzled about it myself.” She laughed, but there
were regretful tears behind the laugh. “Seems
to me women don’t always know exactly what
they’re at. Folks don’t always see their road
clear in front o’ their feet. There’s a time for
everything, I reckon, that’s what it is, and it
hadn’t come just then for you and me.”</p>

<p>“Anyway, it’s come now, thanks be!” he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
said in a sudden burst, and he stopped his angry
pacing and came to her side. “But all the same,”
he persisted, “I’d ha’ liked it perfect all through.
There’s things as hurt to look back on more than
a deal. There’s times I’ve heard her rating the
poor old chap, I’ve felt that bad I could ha’
shot myself right out. ’Twas summat like as if
he’d been clapped in jail; as if you an’ me
had gone and put him in quod.”</p>

<p>She put her hands on his shoulders, her eyes
filling with tears.</p>

<p>“Nay, now—don’t—don’t! You make me
feel that bad.”</p>

<p>“And him so kind,” he went on, as if unable
to stop. “Ay, it makes you feel bad enough
to swear.”</p>

<p>“It’s over ... it’s by wi’ ... we’ll make
it up to him, you’ll see!” He put his arms about
her, and her hands went up around his neck.
“You’ll not be keeping a grudge agen me all
our lives?”</p>

<p>“Nay, it’s myself I’m sore with, not you. I
should ha’ done my duty by the old chap, and
trusted you’d come to me in the end. But I
wasn’t for taking the risk. I was over feared.
And now I doubt I’ll always feel sort o’ shamed.”</p>

<p>“Things’ll sort themselves out, don’t you
fret. They’ll right themselves sure as a bobbin,
after a bit.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span></p>

<p>“Likely they will.”</p>

<p>“It’ll make a sight o’ difference, once he’s
back. You’ll never think twice o’ yon weary
time no more.”</p>

<p>“Likely I waint.”</p>

<p>“And you’ll not throw it up at me when you’re
mad?” she begged. “You’ll not forget just
how it come about?”</p>

<p>“I tell you I blame myself,” he repeated,
“and nobody else. Happen I wanted you that
bad I’d to pay a bigger price than most. Or
happen we were both on us driven, and couldn’t
help ourselves at all. But like enough it’ll all
come right, as you say, and it’s nobbut fools as
frets themselves, looking back.”</p>

<p>“We’ve come out a deal better than we
deserve!” She smiled and drew away from
him, looking happy again. “We took a deal
o’ risk, you an’ me, but we’ve bit on our feet, I
reckon, after all....” She drifted back to
the table, as to an altar on which their sacrifice
of thanksgiving was set. “What can ha’ come
to the trap, Thomas? Father’ll be wearied out
afore they land.... I mind you said he liked
a bit o’ ham to his tea. You said Marget wasn’t
for giving him ham if she could help.”</p>

<p>“She’d ha’ given him nowt,” Thomas growled,
“if it wasn’t she was feared o’ finishing him off.
Brass she was getting for him was over good to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
lose. He never eat what I give her, I’ll be
bound.... Ay, he’d always a fancy-like for
ham, and when he’d finished he’d gang outside
for his smoke. There’s a new pipe I bought
him, somewheres. Marget took t’other off him,
Bob said.... Ay, an’ there’s some of his pet
bacca in a tin.”</p>

<p>“Have you finished yon seat you were making
for him under t’hedge?”</p>

<p>“Ay, it’s finished right enough. A gradely
seat it is an’ all—a sight better than t’other as
used to be by t’door. If you’ll stop fidging over
yon table you might take a look for yourself.”</p>

<p>She laughed and went out with him into the
porch. Their figures divided the sun as they
stood, so that they looked like swimmers deep
in the streaming gold. Their heads leaned together
as they nodded approval at the seat, a
wooden bench in the arms of a well-laid fence.
It was a grand seat, Agnes said, and a grand
evening for anybody wanting to sit out. They
pictured the old man sitting there, warming
himself in the last of the sun. They were excited
and full of plans again, like children preparing
for a treat. She had her hand on his arm,
peering across him round the porch, when the
trap suddenly lumbered into sight. It might
have been dumped out of space on the straight-ruled
road, a languid object jolting over the flat.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
Thomas, meditating proudly upon the seat,
turned about to a hasty prod.</p>

<p>“There it be, Thomas—there it be! Trap, I
mean, man—look ye—can’t ye see? Be off
now as smart as you can. They’ll be here afore
you’ve made shift to start.”</p>

<p>She tried to push him out of the porch, deaf
to his protest that the trap had a fairish piece to
cover yet. “A bonny time it’ll take an’ all,”
he added, “wi’ yon bag o’ bones atween the
shafts. Seems like it meant liggin’ down for a
bit of a nap.”</p>

<p>“Best be soon than late,” she urged. “Nay,
now, be off, do!”—and he allowed himself to
be shoved on to the path, grinning at her eager
face. “I’ll have kettle singing by you’re back,”
she went on, “and then there’ll be nowt to keep
us from setting to, right off. Bob’ll have a bite
o’ summat, likely, afore he makes off. Eh,
but I’m right fain to see the old man’s face when
he passes t’door.”</p>

<p>“He’ll find summat better than Marget to
look at, and that’s sure!” he teased her, lingering,
and she stamped her foot at him and cried:</p>

<p>“Get on, you gert soft!”</p>

<p>And he answered, “I <em>is</em> getting on!” and
stood like a stock.</p>

<p>The farm, full of the evening sun, and with
smiling figures at its door, made a gay enough<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
welcome for the exile that was drawing towards
it over the marsh. Thomas received a final
wave of mingled speeding and threat, and then
the blue gown vanished through the porch.
“We mun do what we can,” he heard her call
from within, “but if we don’t suit him better
than Marget, I’ll shut up house!”</p>

<p>Then he was gone at last, his broad figure
dwindling as he went, until the high hedges
hid him and the wild roses closed above his
head. Away on the road, coming to meet him,
the trundling speck grew and grew in size.
As he dwindled and disappeared, so it enlarged
and sharpened into sight. There was something
fateful, indeed, about its slow yet determined
approach. One knew, without dreaming of
asking, that its errand was for the farm. In
spite of its slow and clumsy advance it reminded
Agnes of a sailing-boat she had seen, coming on
high water across the glancing bay. It had
seemed to come straight from the village under
the hill to the farm that stood alone on the
edge of the sand. Wind and tide were both at
its back, driving it on a flowing path that seemed
to have no possible end except in the house
itself. She had watched it from that upstairs
room upon which she had been at work so long,
and had seen it heaving towards her, purposeful
and direct. As it drew nearer the shore without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
slackening its speed, she began to feel almost
afraid. The tilted bowsprit seemed ruled to
the last inch on the window of the room. It
was like a racer, nearing the post, leaping ahead
along the last stretch. It was like a child,
hurrying to be home, heedless of any obstacle
in the way. She could not see the man in charge
for the sail, so that the boat seemed like a thing
by itself, a toy launched by the impetus of some
mighty hand. She felt certain it meant to try
to sail to her in the room, and would dash itself
on the sea-wall just below. There was even a
moment when she leaned from the window to
scream, because it looked as though nothing
could stop it now it was so near. And then,
just as it seemed that the bow was over the
hedge, it had swung on its heel and forgotten
and gone away.... Like swinging a reel on a
thread, she thought to herself; as easy as
turning the handle of a door. Now it was leaning
over, beating into the wind, and she could
see a figure in the sheets. Quickly, though more
slowly than it had come, it went away, fretting
and fuming where it had been smoothly intent,
and fighting where it had almost seemed to fly.
She watched it beating back and forth for a
time, hoping it might return, but always it
threshed away into the wind, and dwindled and
lost meaning and never looked back. And it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
had never come since, however high the tide,
in that spirit of leaping joy directed at the
farm.</p>

<p>Of course there was nothing like it about the
trap, heavy and crawling and jolting along the
road. But it, too, seemed headed towards her
as she stood, as if it saw what was coming and
couldn’t by any chance be stopped. And if
Bob wouldn’t come in to share the evening meal,
the trap, like the boat, would never reach the
farm. It, too, the moment it had arrived,
would turn its back on the place, and go away....</p>

<p>A sense of loneliness came upon her in the
sunny room, and the house that had been so
full of expectation and content grew still and
listened for old voices and called again upon its
hidden ghosts. She wished now that she had
gone with Thomas to the gate, to share in the
home-coming from the first. Indeed, she started
to run down the path and through the gate,
and found herself out in the meadow before she
scolded herself and returned with a laugh.
This was Thomas’s father, not hers, who was
coming to-day. Her own had been dead for
ever so many years. She was only the son’s
wife, and her place was to welcome him at the
door. She remembered the kettle, too, as she
hurried back, and was glad she had had the sense
to turn in time. She couldn’t help wishing,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
however, that she might have been there. She
would have known, in that first moment,
whether her conscience might be at ease....</p>

<p>Back in the kitchen, she filled the kettle and
set it on the fire, struggling with the temptation
to take another peep at the room upstairs.
She argued with herself that she wanted to
make sure nothing had been missed, knowing
all the while that she had been perfectly sure
for hours. It could not be long now before she
ushered the old man in, and surely she could
manage to wait till then? The room would
be all the fresher if she could bring herself to
wait, would look to her something of what it
looked to him.... Thomas’s reparation was
through outward things, she thought—shelter
and physical ease and a decent burying at the
last; but hers was through things more subtle,
touches that eased the heart.... More than
comfort and look went to that carpet on the
stairs.</p>

<p>She wondered, looking round, which of the
changes would strike him first. Which of the
new things would catch his eye—the range, the
padded chair, the spoons, or the new pots?
There was a shelf with reading of some sort,
mostly about farming, she believed; and a gate-leg
table, left her by an aunt, on which he could
lay his fiddle if he chose. In the parlour, of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
course, there were treasures without price,
wedding-presents and suchlike and sudden
fancies at sales; but Sunday, she thought,
would be time enough for those. They would
have to be careful not to worrit the old man.
The kitchen alone would be enough for to-night—that
and the other surprises up above.</p>

<p>She had been puzzled to find in herself this
sudden passion for a house. She had been
willing and busy enough at home, but she had
always been glad to get finished and go out.
Now, when she went out, she had almost to
tear herself away; her household gods might
play her false while she was gone. All the inanimate
things that made her work—furniture
and pots and pans and the rest—they seemed
strangely alive to her now, and capable of mischief
if she left them too long alone. Even in
church she thought of fire and moths, of dry-rot
and damp and water-spouts gone wrong. When
once the hay was in she felt sure she would
never go out at all, but would spend her days
watching for the first thread of smoke. There
was that fire at Crookfield, only last year, when
the dogs had awakened the folk in the pouring
dark. They had pulled the furniture out into
the yard, and set the pillows and beds along the
wall. You did not want to do that every year
with your best beds, and there was a wardrobe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
or so that never got out at all. Then, on the
marsh, there was a further terror to fear—floods
that swam into your rooms and left them damp
for years. She could see she would fret herself
thin before she was through! Of course the
possessive fury would die down after a while,
but she did not want it to die too soon. The
new passion fretted her, but it braced her as
well; made her feel strong and capable and
rich and proud....</p>

<p>And just as she had not known of this feeling
for a house, so she had not known that a man
could count for so much. She puzzled sometimes,
staring at Thomas, and thinking how
strange it was that eyes should so alter their
point of view. Why, there were things she loved
about him now for which she had laughed at
him before! He was still only the Thomas whom
she had flouted so long, and from whom she had
parted without a pang; yet now, when he turned
his back, she had a sense of fear, as if he had
left her straying in some lonely place.... But
even now she did not know why she had ever
rebelled, could find no clue, however vexed for
the missed years. It could only be that it
wasn’t the right time, as she had said. And,
after all, Thomas was not the man she had
known. She would never see that Thomas of
hers again. The strange thing was that she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
sometimes wanted that Thomas back—angry
and sullen, or awkward and afraid.</p>

<p>Sometimes she held her breath, remembering
how narrowly her fortune had been reaped.
Thomas had never asked her again after that
dogged appeal for his father in the lane. He
stayed at hand, it was true, he spoke when
they met, and they danced together as before,
but he had never again asked her to be his wife.
And perhaps his drawing-back had worked the
miracle at last, for it was certainly about that
time that she had begun to change. Perhaps
it was just the natural impulse to want the
thing out of reach, or maybe she had a vision of
life, of the part that burdens may bear in it
and be sweet. Just possibly it was Marget
who was the real factor in the change, setting
the levers pity and jealousy to work.</p>

<p>Agnes had known Bob’s wife from a child,
and needed no telling how Kit would fare at
her hands. They had been at school together
first, though Marget was much the elder of the
two, and afterwards they had been rivals or
friends as things had happened to run. But
Marget had married early and grown old soon,
or rather had reached the vinegary age and there
remained. Agnes had tried to keep up the
acquaintance for a while, but it was not long
before her visits ceased. Marget had grown<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
into a shrew as mushrooms grow between
showers, and of a subtle variety before which
Agnes shrank. She had known shrews before,
and found them human enough, with hearts
that were more or less kindly under their fretted
nerves. They were not like Marget, venomous
all through. She remembered something in
Marget, as a child, that had given her even
then a kind of power, something inhuman, implacable
and cold, that edged her words and
barbed the look in her eyes. It had won her a
sort of distinction as a girl, so that others had
wanted her as well as Bob, but time had soon
shown it as merely the passion of a cold woman
for riding others down. Agnes, warm-hearted,
tolerant and gay, was frankly afraid of Marget
by the end. Marget liked to talk of Thomas and
hint and jeer, and if the other gave battle in
his defence she was terrible indeed. In spite
of her idleness and slovenly ways, she still
contrived to be terrible and a power. Her
methods made Agnes shiver in her chair—thin
and insidious and trickling at the first, and then,
at the point of contact, bursting forth. She
was like an iceberg, chilling you from afar, and
crushing and riving and blinding you when you
struck. You felt her icy paralysis as you sank;
you heard her shrill-voiced grindings as you
drowned. Agnes fled from the combat and did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
not return, and the reports of her one-time rival
worsened with the years. Yet it was up to this
arctic terror she had delivered Kit.</p>

<p>But at the end of everything she had married
Thomas just for himself, and not for his father
or anybody else at all. The finish had come
about at Appleton Hall, one of those old homes
that, changing from manor-house to farm, have
yet contrived to keep their dignity intact. Both
she and Thomas were helping as usual at the
boon-clip, which fell that year on the hottest
day in June. It was always a long day and
often hot, but this was the longest and finest
she had ever known. Afterwards she divided
her life into—life, and then “the clip.” If it
was true that she had had to wait for the right
time, the right time came royally enough on a
day so splendid that it seemed bound to affect
some destiny before it passed.</p>

<p>She went up to the farm early, before the
heat, and was in time to see the sheep coming
down from the fells. There was still a haze
over the tops, and through it the complaining
voices drove and dropped, reaching her long
before she saw the flock. When they came out
of the haze at last, with their heavy fleeces
trailing to the ground, they had the effect of a
drifting, woolly cloud. Slim, ghostly dogs
darted in and out of the cloud, and behind them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
the slender silhouette of a horseman shaped
itself through the mist. He had a lamb slung
before him when he rode into the yard, a tiny,
black-faced thing with dangling hoofs.</p>

<p>Other girls joined her as she went in through
the arch, all of them splashes of cool colour in
their fresh print gowns. The arch stood twenty
feet high in the monster courtyard wall, and
topping the wall was a crown of grass and fern.
Fern and the dark velvet of old moss were so
much a part of the wall that it might have been
fashioned of them from the start. At present
the yard was in deep shadow, and the house a
mere breath of a house, a huddle of formless
grey. The covered stone passage was lost and
dark that ran along its side. The tall arched
windows showed nothing but pools of gloom
behind their diamond panes. In spite of voices
through its rooms and clatter on its flags, the
place seemed barely alive, an embryo slowly
evolving with the day. But when the sun, in
the wake of the woolly cloud, had climbed the
fell and was full above the yard, the house would
alter and gain body and stand up firm. Its
thick walls would grow solid to the eye, and
the lines of them spring out sharp and straight.
Its roots would go down deep, and its chimneys
would be massed like towers. Colour would
come into the grey, and the weight of centuries<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
lie heavy on its roof. Its vagueness would take
on meaning and the unchanging speech of form,
together with the aloof dignity of those whose
times are other than man’s.</p>

<p>For some time she was at work indoors, helping
to prepare the food for the day, passing in and
out of the dim rooms, each of which seemed to
have its own quality of shade, and through low
doorways with sudden steps, and up and down
curving, whitened stairs. In the high, flagged
room that had once been the hall, tables were
set on trestles for the afternoon feast. The
great beam of the old chimney still showed above
the hearth, and high in one of the blue-washed
walls was a niche where the fiddler would sit to
play. Often and often Agnes had seen old Kit
perched aloft in the narrow place that had the
look of some ancient shrine.</p>

<p>The stone passage beside the house had four
arches opening on to the yard, and when the
sun came they made inky frames for figures
moving and standing in blinding light, shears
that shone like the swords over Eden’s Gate,
snowy fleeces and the pathetic faces of many
sheep. The whole courtyard was full, after a
while, set like a stage with the clippers on their
creels. The sun beat clear upon them as they
worked, carving the sheep, as it were, from
shreds of the woolly cloud. Only under the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
south wall and the big horse-chestnuts was
there any shade, and here in the sudden gloom
the faces looked pale, and the cotton kytles of
the men were like moths motionless in an evening
dusk. Boys tugged the unwilling sheep from
the pens and scuffled with them across the yard,
or thrust them, clipped, through the wicket
in the arch, to meet the branding-iron outside.
They looked awkward and strange as they
scuttled away, with the inky letters sharp on
their close wool. The lambs came up with
innocent eyes and open, wailing mouths. They
reached out tentative noses, faintly surprised,
and were suddenly satisfied and still.</p>

<p>Across the yard was another cool cavern with
the yellow slits of open doors yawning in two
of its black walls. This was the fleecing-room
where the girls were at work, rolling the fleeces
and flinging them into the loft. The lock-trimmer
sat beside the door, trimming the
fleeces as they came in. The soft whiteness of
them lay across his knees, and the shears
glanced and flashed and made lightnings in the
sun.</p>

<p>It was a boon-clip, which meant that the
farmers round had come to help, or had sent
their sons or daughters or hired men, and one
or two sons of squires were at work with the
shears as well. There were certain clippers who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
always came, and who always sat in the same
place, just as the lock-trimmer was always the
“lock,” and the man with the tar-pot always
had the tar. Thomas was one of those who
always came, and his place was under the wall
of the house facing the arch. Agnes knew why
he had chosen this place, though it was one of
the hottest in the yard. When he looked out
through the arch and the steam of the tar rising
misty in the air, he could see the land rolling
westward to the sea. “I like to set looking
towards the marsh,” he always said; “I don’t
feel suited anywheres else,” and though he could
not see the marsh for the curving land, he knew
where it lay by the light in the sky, as all
marsh-bred people know. Year after year he
had sat there at the clip, and lifted his head
when a pause came, and looked out. But
to-day he had left the place for somebody
else. To-day he was in the shade by the south
wall.</p>

<p>Agnes brought him his first drink, and he
took it without so much as a look or a word,
and though she had lingered a moment after
he took up his shears, they still had not spoken
nor had their glances met. She knew well
enough, of course, why he had moved; there
was no need for him to be afraid that she might
ask. All these years when he looked through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
the arch he had looked towards his home, and
after all the years there was a stranger in his
home. There was no point now in looking towards
the place where it had been. His eye, as
it travelled, would check itself in its flight, just
as his body would stop and turn away at the
door.</p>

<p>She thought about it all day as she went about
her work, or studied him from some corner out
of sight. For the first time he was pathetic in
her eyes, forsaken, cast-off, a creature without
a place. He had a lonely look, she said to herself—poor
Thomas without a home! He was a
lonely soul, to whom life was being unkind. He
might have been master, for instance, and still
was only man. He might have had father and
wife as well as farm, and instead he had only
his dour and dogged self. She, too, had contracted
the habit of looking towards the marsh,
and had wondered a little and put the wonder
by. Now, when she looked, she, too, had a
sense of wrong in the loss of a home that might
so well have been hers. She began to think
of the stranger from her lover’s point of view,
as an intruder thrusting himself into settled
lives. She felt fiercely towards him as towards
a cuckoo in the nest, forgetting that she herself
had brought the position about. The thing
worked in her all the day, gradually weighting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
and tilting the scale of her heart. Protective
affection sprang up in her full-grown. Thomas,
successful and sure, had not been able to win
her even in years, but Thomas the failure laid
hold of her in an hour. She could not bear that
his face should be turned from his own marsh!...
From one point and another she watched
him all day long.</p>

<p>She saw the sheep go back again to their
heafs, soft, snowy woolballs on the shining
green. Going up, as in coming down, they gave
the same impression of moving cloud. They
travelled up the fell like smoke blown from
a giant’s pipe, with no hint of the toil of
thousands of little feet. They were going fast,
too, though they looked strangely slow on the
vast expanse of ground. It was only when she
marked them by the end of the long stone wall
that she saw how rapidly they climbed. They
were like a wave surging always up and up,
smoothly, determinedly, drawn by invisible
cords. While her eye still watched the corner
at the top, they were near it, they were round
it, they were all of them silently gone....</p>

<p>After the meal in the big hall there were the
usual trotting races and sports. Thomas had
always taken a leading part in these events,
but to-day he kept dismally aloof, unconsciously
helping his new impression on her heart. And at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
the end of the day there had been the usual
dance.</p>

<p>She happened to be upstairs when the fiddle
struck up, and in the cool of the evening she
leaned out to hark. Through the windows below
she caught the jollity of the reel, the thin cry
of the strings and the stamp of feet on the flags.
In the room behind her where the great four-posters
were, the shadows were creeping and
climbing and laying the draperies of the night.
There were always shadows within the curtains
of the beds, as if they had come for those who
had lain there dead, and had never had time to
lift and scatter away. With the night there
were the shadows of night as well, so that in
shadow on shadow those who slept in the beds
must lie. On the house itself there was shadow,
the mighty shadow of the fells, and suddenly
she longed for a room on the edge of things,
looking starkly out to sea. There, in the night,
one could always breathe, at least. She leaned
further until the roses came up about her face,
and then she saw Thomas standing by the
pens.</p>

<p>At once, as she looked, the veil of her long
bewilderment fell away. Now she knew what
she wanted, what she meant to do. The wind
of that longing for air and space had swept the
cloudy room of her mind, and there, with his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
face to herself and his back to the sea, Thomas
was all that the sudden wind had left....
He moved, as if meaning to go, and almost in
panic she turned and ran from the room, flying
through twisting passages and over the sagging
floors. Shafts of light rayed across her from
deep-cut window-slits; polished oak doors
gleamed at her back as she sped down the
bowed and winding stairs. The flood of music
and dance swelled up to her as she approached,
and she paused for a moment as she passed the
room. After the soft purples out of doors which
the sun was leaving behind, the room seemed
misty and full of a golden dusk, yellow with lamps
resisting the dying day. High in the wall the
sawing arm that held the bow flung the wild music
over the crowd, whirling figures and brown faces
and gowns that made streaks of colours under
the lights. The mist and the music and the
beat of the feet made her head spin as she stood
and looked. Her face and gown were framed
by the door and the dark behind, and a partner
began to edge towards her round the crowd.
He was still some distance away when he saw
her disappear, like a ghost caught away from the
door by hidden hands. Again the longing for
space had seized her as she looked. She slid
round the door and fled to Thomas in the
yard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span></p>

<p>They were well on their way to her home
before either found anything to say; and then,
“What made you quit so soon?” she enquired
with a rush at last.</p>

<p>He answered her, staring gloomily at the road,
that the place was overcrowded by a deal. He
wasn’t as set on dancing as he used. “Likely
I’m getting old,” he added; “that’ll be it.”
And then, after minutes and minutes he let
himself go.... “I couldn’t abide hearing yon
fiddle played.’Twas fiddle as fetched me out,
if you want to know.”</p>

<p>He turned his head as he spoke, and tried to
look through the hedge, and it was west and not
east of them where the Hall lay that he looked.
Here in the lane, as in the yard, he seemed to
hear a fiddle that was dumb, thin and trembling
and clear from the edge of the sea. Standing
outside the dance he had heard the two musics
mingle and clash, and had turned from the sound
in the hot room to the sound that drew over
miles from the cool tide.</p>

<p>“What fetched <em>you</em> out?” he asked of her,
in his turn.</p>

<p>They had stopped in the road as if at some
word of command, and the swinging curves of
the lane went winding before and behind,
shutting them in together this way and hiding
them safe together that. The sun, level on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
fields as if smoothed by a hand, was below the
thick barrier of the mounted hedge. Only
through chinks or the eye of a gate could it
find a way, to lie in patches on the hedgerow
grass, or splash its pools on the heavily-rutted
road. It was more restful than sleep in that
cleft between the fields, where the roses, sprayed
overhead, took a richer colour against the sky.
There was green upon green on the background
of dark wood—bramble and hazel, convolvulus
and thorn. There were yellow and purple and
white sweet peeping faces in the grass; ferns,
emerald-fresh, stately in thick groups. And
close in the hedge-side, where all else was new,
lingered the old dead beech leaves of the year
before, waiting for this year’s leaves to drift
there, too....</p>

<p>Already, though the clippings were barely
through, folk were getting to work at the hay.
Away, as the land rose fast, they could see a
cutter at work, and the flash of the horses’ sides
as they turned in the sun. The sound of the
cutter made sweeter their solitude and peace,
yet the voice of it in the silence loosened their
difficult tongues.</p>

<p>“I reckon I’ve made up my mind now,”
Agnes said, facing him sturdily as he looked
away. “Likely I’ve lost you wi’ keeping you
hanging round so long. It’s nowt to wonder at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
if you’re tired, I’m sure. But if you’re still set
on our getting wed, there’s nowt as I can see
agen putting up the banns....</p>

<p>“It’s a bit sudden, happen,” she went on, as
he did not speak, “and yet I don’t know as
it’s sudden, after all. It’s been coming along
for a goodish while, I doubt, and what finished
it off was you changing your spot in the yard.
It made me feel queer like, after all these years.
The folks settin’ round you had all on ’em got
homes, an’ there you were settin’ among ’em
wi’ none at all. There was Tommy Todd, you’ll
think on, as nobody need want, wi’ as good a
missis as there is in the country-side. There
was Neddy Gibbs—him as is near half-rocked—he’s
a rare good home at the back of him as well.
Bob Martin and Billy Dent—ay, an’ his brother,
Willie George—they’ve all on ’em homes they
can gang to if they want. I could see the doors
open at their backs, set for ’em to come in, but
I couldn’t see owt at the back o’ Thomas Sill.
I could set a door wi’ the best on ’em, I’ll be
bound! I’m sure an’ certain I’d be fain to
try....”</p>

<p>But miracles under one’s eyes are the last
things one believes. “It’s pity,” he muttered,
refusing to look up. “I’m right enough where
I be ... you’ve no call to fret. It’s pity ...
same as you felt for him....”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span></p>

<p>“It’s nowt o’ the sort,” she exclaimed angrily,
and then laughed. “I’ll learn you whether it’s
pity if you get talking stuff like yon! If it’s
pity, I reckon any lass would do, same as I
rather think I said afore. But yon home as I’m
wanting for you can’t be made by nobody but
me—and—eh, you daft lad—I’m wanting it an
all!”</p>

<p>It was the shortest lane in the world, just as
the day was the longest in all time. Often
enough, hurrying home, she had sighed at its
length, but now it fled behind her while her feet
were still. Every bend as it came was strange
to her eyes, and, turning, she saw it new from
the other side. The sun slid away from the
fields like a curtain silently withdrawn, and up
on the higher land the cutter whirred to a corner
and was still. In the lane the night came long
before it touched the land beyond—the visible,
purple night that has no knowledge of the real
dark. The roses, paled of their pink, showed
whitened starry faces to the sky, shining above
the road like blossoms laid on a pool. Only
where some big tree leaned across was there any
real night, and as they passed beneath it and
so out, they lost each other for a moment in
the dark, and found each other on the further
side, just as in life they had lost each other
for a time, and yet come together, after all.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
They heard the birds stir in sudden flutters
and be still. They heard wild things in the hedgerow
rustle and be still. Horses came to the fence
and reached out shadowy heads, and through
continual gates they caught the remnants of
the lingering day. Sheep in the hedge-bottoms
rose and scuttered away, the sound of their
going ghostly in the dark. Cattle, lying heavy
on the land, turned unaffrighted eyes at their
approach. The night air pressed close, warm
and a little damp, and there was dew on the
long hedge-grass as well as the honeysuckle
boughs.</p>

<p>“I doubt it’s over late for the farm,” Agnes
murmured once. “Eh, if we could nobbut
set the clock back a year!”</p>

<p>“There’s a chance we might get it yet,”
Thomas replied, but with the new caution he
had learned from life. Self-confident Thomas
had grown to be careful how he tempted
fate. “The new man’s shaping badly, so they
say....”</p>

<p>She gave a little cry of excitement, and then
sighed.</p>

<p>“I don’t deserve it, I’m sure; but eh, Thomas,
if we should! We’d make it the best spot
anywheres about, and we’d have your father
to live with us right off. We’d do our best to
make up to him all we could....”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span></p>

<p>But she had forgotten Kit once more when
she found herself at her gate, and heard her
lover’s step going from her down the lane. In
her bedroom she watched the moon come up,
over the road where they had walked, the
patient moon that had not hurried or spied.
Parts of the lane would be as bright as day
where for their passing had been a velvet dusk.
Folks who walked there now would have to
whisper low, because voices carried so clearly
under the moon. They would see their own
shadows close about their feet, so that they
would be four instead of two, and therefore
never alone. Thomas and she had had no
shadows at all, and even the shadows of their
wasted years had been hidden by the night.</p>

<p>They had got the farm, after all, but they had
had another year to wait. The new tenant’s
fate had hung in the balance for some time,
and though, when the end came, it came short
and sharp, there had been much to do before
they could move in. The new tenant, who had
never had time to become an old tenant, had yet
contrived to occasion many repairs. They had
had to furnish, of course, and that meant visits
to sales, and hours of pondering in Witham shops.
There was also her mother to settle with a decent
hired girl. The old woman’s house was her
own, and she had no notion of coming to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
farm. “The old man’ll keep you stirring, as it
is,” she said to her daughter, when the point
was raised. “Young folks as is newly-wed
don’t want old folks hanging round their necks.
It’ll make you feel what you’ll come to, if it
doesn’t do nowt else....”</p>

<p>So she stayed in the house between the
fields while Agnes went to the marsh, and though
she paid her an afternoon visit now and then,
she could not be coaxed to stop for as much as
a night. Agnes would have been glad enough
of her company, at times. She found the marsh
very lonely at first, and the hours were long
when Thomas was out on the land. She did
not mind very much when the weather was
fine, and she could see the houses winking across
the sands, but it was dreary indeed when the
bay was blotted out and there was nothing to
break the shaken veil of the rain. That was
one of her reasons for welcoming old Kit; they
would be such cronies, she and the old man!
She would see him about the garden while she
was at work in the house, and could call to him
from the windows if she felt inclined. Just to
hear her own voice answered once in a while
would give the place a feeling of fresh life. They
would sit on the new seat shelling peas, or
watching the fishing boats making home with
their catch, their sails three-cornered blurs on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
the opal evening sky. They would sit on the
white-stoned hearth of a winter’s night, and
watch the fire burn red with the hardening of
the frost. He would have tales to tell when the
gales came out in the spring, and the narrow
sea deepened and frothed into driven flood.
Thomas would be out with the sheep, and she
would want a tale to distract her from the
storm. And sometimes, perhaps, Kit would
play her the old, thin tunes, bringing the dance-itch
back to her sober feet. That careless
pleasure seemed to have dropped behind—not
but what she could dance with the smartest
yet. But she seemed to herself to have shut
a door at her back, and behind that door were
the strains of a violin.</p>

<p>She began to sing as she went about, and her
voice escaped through the open windows and
fled away through the door; yet it was in the
house all the time as well. Down on the shore
a man looked up as he stepped on the sands,
hearing the voice that was both within and without.
The house looked empty, he thought, with
all its windows wide, and the voice that sang
seemed a bodiless voice, making the house the
emptier for its song. It followed him as he went
leisurely out, making for the channel and the
farm across. He did not hurry, for the tide
would not be ready to turn for over an hour.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
Presently he was on the bank, hailing the farm
for a boat, and his voice, shrill and lost-sounding
in the open space, broke like a cry for help
across the joy of the song. Thomas, down by
the gate, heard both the song and the cry, but
the old man coming in the trap heard only the
fiddle singing on his knee.</p>

<p>She sang so long that she did not know when
she stopped, but Thomas, down by the gate,
felt as if a fiddle-string had snapped. He had
the same sense as of something wounded and
ceasing to be. It was just at that moment the
trap checked at his side....</p>

<p>The wife in the house looked out and saw
the marsh roads empty north and east and south.
The crawling speck she had watched so long
must have reached its stopping-place at last.
She thought again of the yacht, swinging so
eagerly over the tide, only to turn so suddenly
at the end. Even the highest hopes, it seemed,
met barriers they could not leap.... But the
trap, when the time came for it to turn, trundling
over land that had once been sailing-ground as
well, would leave something behind it when it
went away. It would leave a heart in haven, a
spirit released, a wanderer come home. She
wondered what they were saying to each other,
away down there under the thick hedges by
the meadow-gate. She wondered if Kit would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
notice the new gate, its new paint and how
easily it swung. The other had been an ancient
of days unwilling to be moved, protesting with
rusty hinges and the creak of rotten wood.
And, when once it was opened, you had to
scurry through, so great was its haste to creak
itself back to rest....</p>

<p>But of course he would never notice it to-night,
after all the excitement of the ride. It
was one of the grand new changes to be shown
him later on. Thomas, trained in sound methods
on a well-kept farm, seemed already to have
changed the character of this. It was almost
as if it had pulled itself together under the
mere glance of his disapproving eye. Roots
looked healthy, the corn was even and getting
ahead; the hedgerows were clear of nettles
and the meadows of thistles—on the whole.
The hay was doing well and was thick at the
roots; they hoped to be cutting in a week. The
old man would be pleased with the new machines,
the cutter and tedder in their brilliant coats of
blue. There were the horses, too, bargains and
rare good beasts. He would hardly know either
stable or shippon, with all that the Squire had
done in the way of repairs. And as for all the
fine new things about the house—why, it would
take a month of Sundays to see them all!</p>

<p>She had, in that last pause, one of those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
rare moments when joy is awaited fully prepared.
All was swept and garnished about her
for this hour, as perfect as she could make it
in the time; perhaps it would never be as
perfect again. Now she could put aside the
work of the weeks and meet the occasion with a
settled mind. Both to herself and to Thomas,
hardly conscious of it though they were, there
was something symbolic in the coming event.
Both recognised, more or less, that they were owed
a grudge by fate. In their search after happiness,
they had made someone sad. In their groping
after each other they had allowed somebody to
be alone. Now that life had given them so
much they were ashamed to think that somebody
was poor. This coming of the old man
stood for atonement on their part, resurrection
on his. It meant the sanction of fate to hold
their consciences clear....</p>

<p>So they had put into this home-coming everything
that they knew of kindly work and
pleasant conspiring and kindly thought. There
was nothing within their compass that they had
left undone, nothing omitted that held a welcome
of its own. They meant him to walk
straight into peace out of the passion through
which he had passed, while they looked on with
relieved hearts, not quite certain whether they
were forgiven sinners or his guardian saints.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
Not that it mattered if only old Kit was
pleased; if only their good but troubled souls
might rest.</p>

<p>And still there was no sign of the guest, though
she felt sure the splendid moment had begun.
Of course they would wait for a final word with
Bob, after Thomas had helped the old man
down. Bob would be asked, of course, to come
to the house, but if he had hired or borrowed
the trap he would have to be getting back.
She had never included Bob in the picture in
her mind, except as a part of the trap as it
lumbered away. And that parting crack would
not be a long one, she felt sure. Kit would be
tired and fretting to get indoors, and Thomas
would know she was waiting for them—and tea.
She was rarely glad she had got that ham for
tea....</p>

<p>Again, as she waited, she felt a wish to go
to the gate. There was no reason, really, why
she shouldn’t run down. The old man would
likely be glad of another arm. Folks getting
up in years were easily upset, and joy was often
a bit terrible to the old. He would be ready for
bed before so long ... and she would wake
in the night and wonder whether he slept. She
forgot the gate in thinking of the room, and how
it would never be quite the same again. Surely
there was no harm in taking a last peep? Those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
folks at the gate wouldn’t be up yet. She would
hear their voices coming up the field, and could
be down in time to meet them at the door.
She looked again and found nothing and made
up her mind. She disappeared up the carpeted
stair.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">Christopher Sill sat in the kitchen at
Marget’s, waiting to be taken away. He
was a tall old man, with broad shoulders that
were now bent, blue, inward-looking eyes and
quiet ways. In spite of his size he gave an impression
of lightness which was partly the frailty
of age and partly the spirit within, but he was
too big for the kitchen, which was smaller than
even his wash-house had been at home. No
matter how he compressed himself, or shrank
into corners and held his breath, he seemed
perpetually in the way. His feet, too, which
had been his innocent pride, once so light in
the dance, and still quite neat in spite of their
clumsy boots, were, so it seemed, the largest in
the world. Either Marget or the children were
for ever catching them as they passed, and in
addition to kicks from other clumsy boots, he
had to bear the onus of every mishap. Apparently
his feet were responsible for every
broken pot, for a spilt pan, for the children’s
torn clothes, for the unsteady baby’s every
fresh bruise. Tumbling over Gran’pa was the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
accepted cause of each new piece of damage
and any sudden, ear-piercing howl. There had
been room for every man’s feet in the house
from which he had come, and full room for a
man’s stride on the long levels of the marsh.
He had never realised his actual bodily size
before.</p>

<p>Nor had he been conscious that human beings
might press too close. He had never troubled
about the crowded rooms in which he had had
to play, the whirling dancers and the thick,
lamp-poisoned air. But he had come to them
with his lungs full of the breath of the marsh,
and had gone out of them to the same clean
draught. And he had never minded the press
below his platform or around his chair, or the
women’s dresses brushing against his knees.
Between himself and the crowd there had often
been the bond of a friendly liking as well as the
tie of a pleasure equally shared. He was depressed
by a scanty gathering, and much preferred
a real crush, even though in the stamping
and shuffling his music was apt to be drowned.
The things that the fiddle were saying reached
every one of them all the same, even those who
were too far from him to hear. The more happy
folks there were, the more happiness there was
in the room, and so it could never be too full.
He had never stifled through the long night<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
hours as here in Marget’s kitchen he stifled in
the day. He and his fiddle were never alone in
there, could never get themselves really out of
sight. The children were always about him,
shrill and curious and infinitely cross, and when
Marget came into the kitchen there was simply
no room for anyone else at all. She seemed to
be sharply and aimlessly all over it at once,
just as an ill-tempered wind seems to blow from
every quarter at the same time. He shrank if
she touched him or came too near, and her
draggled gowns worried him as they passed.</p>

<p>The kitchen was dark, not only because there
would have been darkness wherever Marget
happened to be, but because its one small
window was shadowed by the chestnuts across
the road. It seemed like a little dark well to
the man who had lived in a wind-freshened
house with the whole of the open west to lighten
his eyes. Yet there might have been something
to love in it, he knew. There were other houses
in the little old row, heavy with roses white
and red, with trellised porches and gay little
flower-beds either side of the door, where on a
summer day the kitchens were little dim places
of cool peace. He knew that, because he had
been into them sometimes, and rested for a
while in an arm-chair by the whitened hearth,
while its proper tenant left him alone or knitted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
in silence with soothing little clicks. There were
geraniums in those windows in pots, and cool,
little starched lace blinds, and though the windows
were small the sun reached round the pots
and dropped a splash of gold on the stone floor.
The pots themselves made patches of mellow
colour on the sill, and there was a text on the
wall which the sun always seemed to find.
“Where the treasure is, there will the heart be
also,” it said, and Kit knew better than anything
else in the world what that text meant. There
was a heap of gold in a bottom corner and a
clutter of angel-crowns above, but Kit knew
that real treasure had nothing to do with things
like those.</p>

<p>On those summer days the footpath under the
trees was black, so that the lasses passing in
their light gowns looked like coloured pictures
on a dark screen. The road was half a patterned
shadow flung by the trees, and half a ribbon of
dazzling limestone white. When carriages came
along, the pattern changed to the horses’ backs,
and the silvered harness flashed and shone in
the sun. Sometimes there was a whirl of dust
after they had passed, but none of it came in
because door and window were shut, yet he
did not feel stifled because the door stood open
into the scullery at the back, and the door of
that again into the garden beyond. You went<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
up to the garden by old steps sunk deep into
the bank, with moss so thick about them that
the colour of it seemed to have grown into
the stone itself. There were bright flowers up
above, mere flecks of colour high and far away,
when the sun was standing over the slanting
beds. The door made a picture for him as he
sat, a vivid shimmer of gold and scarlet and
green, yet it was too far off to trouble his old
eyes. Sometimes he stared at it until he slept,
with the polished fiddle gleaming across his
knee. The silent knitter would watch the fiddle
with an anxious eye, waiting to catch it when
it slipped. But even in sleep his fingers held
it safe, because always in sleep it was with him
where he went.</p>

<p>He used to thank the people in these houses
of good rest, but he was not always perfectly
certain which was which, and to the day of his
death he never knew their names. There were
real corners in those kitchens of theirs, where
the old could gather themselves into the shadow
unobserved. The kitchen at Marget’s was
exactly the same size, but it had no corners
that he could ever find; only bare walls set
rigidly each to each, where naughty children
could be sent to sulk, and dust might settle and
gather at its will. The other kitchens had space
and they had peace. Those of their occupants<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
who thought them poor and mean found themselves
suddenly proud in possession after he
had gone. It was as if he had placed a charm
on the table before he went away.</p>

<p>But he was not often able to seek these hiding-places
from the storm. Marget was one of those
souls jealous of a burden they do not want but
will not share. Even while she resented his
presence under her roof, she resented equally
that he should be happy anywhere else. He was
welcome to hate her as much as he chose, but
she demanded that he should hate other folk as
well. If he was hers to see to, she would have
him all to herself, and nobody should take him
from her even for half an hour. Besides, she
lacked the full flavour of abuse when he wasn’t
about the house. In the dark kitchen, in spite
of his size, she could not always be sure that
he was there. She might trip over something
and snarl, “Drat you! Mind your feet!”
before she discovered that it was only a stool.</p>

<p>So it was not very often he could get away;
she hunted him down too rigorously for that.
And even out of her sight he was conscious of
the obsession of her thought. Even during
those snatched moments, seldom as they came,
there lurked round every corner the possibility
of her face. It was only in sleep that he ever
really escaped, and even then he awoke sometimes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
to find her watching him from the door—her
gnawed and useless bone that she still would
drag to her cave.</p>

<p>She said such terrible things, too, to the silent
knitters of his peace. Suddenly the little kitchen
would be full of battering, brazen-sounding
speech, carrying so far along the street that folk
would hear it and come out. When Marget
emerged with her bone between her teeth, they
would be standing in little knots or edging towards
the door. Little boys came out of nowhere
as they always do, and sometimes a passing
carriage would be brought to a halt. Through
it all Marget would swim on a powerful stream of
abuse, while he went quiet in her clutch, his
fiddle gathered close. Sometimes people laughed,
and he heard, and that was worst of all.</p>

<p>Only at night had he respite for a while. Two
of the children slept in his little room, and even
they, incredibly curious as they were, were
forced to close their peering eyes at times.
The old man, kept awake when he might
have slept, could not always sleep later on, and
often sat for hours by his window, looking out
into the night. Up there, it almost seemed as
though he were in the chestnuts over the road,
only out in the branches where the birds slept
it was cool, and full of a rocked and murmuring
peace. Sometimes, though, on the stillest nights,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
not a leaf moved or shook on the giant boughs,
but more often there was a little breeze that
whispered busily all the time. There was a
wind, too, that did nothing but sigh, and another
that hissed in angry little gusts. The one that
sighed meant that thunder was about, and the
fretted one was the herald of change and rain.
And another wind rolled in a long, soft soughing
all the way through the trees, like the long,
smooth waves of a very far-off tide. It would
swell and rise while he listened for it to break,
but always it ebbed and died without breaking
at all. Sometimes it stopped in the midst of
the downward curve, like a sentence softly
suspended without cause. He liked this wind
because it took him back to the marsh, but
best of all he liked the big gales that came
to him straight from the west. The wind that
thrashed and tramped on the great trees, that
hammered the little window of his room and
sent great draughts down chimneys and through
keyholes, and flung the blue slates spinning into
the street, came to him straight from the place
where he belonged. Sometimes, when it was
very dark and wild, he was sure the street was
full of the sea. He thought of it rolling and
pushing at all the doors.... There was a
meadow beyond the chestnuts over the road,
and often he heard the water under the wall,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
like the tide that beat at the banks along the
marsh.</p>

<p>He was fond of that meadow beyond the trees,
with its shimmering levels golden in the sun,
yet cool to the eye because of the shadow in
between. At first he spent his time by the
leaning wall, talking to people as they came
along, but that was another thing Marget
couldn’t abide. Strangers stared at his violin,
and asked questions, and that vexed her pride.
It was like a beggar-man, she said, to be seen
with a fiddle in the street. Folks would be
giving him coppers before so long, and shaming
them all and pulling them all down. Kit held
to his talking-ground for a while, but after one
dreadful episode he gave way. Sometimes
people asked if the old man were dead, the old
man with the fiddle beside the wall.</p>

<p>He liked the meadow best of all in the dawn,
when it took on the look of parkland wrapped
in early mist. Right across, through a break
in the chestnuts, he could see another tree
stand up, a tree that, because of the haze, looked
tiny as a toy. The shadow of it, black when the
sun got up, was at first no more than a darker
veil of mist along the sward. There was magic
about this little vignette in which there was
only a tree. It was so tiny and grey and tender,
so light, so delicately soft. Yet, small as it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
was, it suggested infinite space, stretches of
wander-room, pleasaunces without end. There
were no barriers about it that had to be pushed
away. You knew that from under its branches
you could see the world.</p>

<p>Even when the sun was up at last, and the
tree was strong wood and the earth firm soil,
when the leaves had found colour and the boughs
taken their shape, the little vista kept its
promise still. Still it was growing in enchanted
air, amid the far distances of the soul’s desire.</p>

<p>And then the house around him would come
awake. The children would fight each other
in their beds. All through the house would
pierce the edginess of Marget’s morning voice....</p>

<p>He lost his vignette when the chestnuts lost
their leaves, and through the stripped boughs
the picture was not the same. But the chestnuts
themselves were enough for him, just then,
with their straight-grown limbs cut black
against the sky, and every delicate filament of
twig sparkling and dazzling with the frost. In
the winter, too, he could see the moon through
the trees, a flat and silver face laid to the open
spaces as to a pane. Star after star he saw
balancing on a bough.</p>

<p>At the end of the village was the river that he
had known only where it ran out over the
sand. It was dear to him, because it went<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
towards the marsh, but otherwise it was not
the river he knew. Out there it was silver or
thin blue, sometimes a dull and hurrying grey,
but always it held the mirror of its face wide
open to the sky. Here it was black, because of
the high banks and the old bridge and the big
trees leaning right across. It was a glorious
black, velvet-smooth, with underneath it the
colours of weeds and stones and darting fish,
and the reflection of other colours overhead.
There were trees in the water, too, as real as
those above; he could not always tell which
was which. They had the same vivid, wide-spreading
green, the same ribbed and splendid
trunks. It was like looking down into a forest
from a bird’s wing, only the forest was overhead
as well. It seemed as far to look down
as it was to look up. He thought the mirror-picture
the daintier of the two—cleaner, as it
were, for the water washing over its face; like
the forests one sees through the polished glass
of a dream. There was only one other difference
that he could see. When the trees above
stood perfectly still, the trees in the water
seemed to wave and dance. But it was only
the ripple across the river’s face. Beneath it
the painted picture was still and serene.</p>

<p>He was fond of the bridge, too, and liked to
wait for the sun dipping under its curve, but it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
was not often that he had a chance of that.
The children were in league with Marget to
hunt him down, and could spy him out in the
most unlikely spots. Then they would harry
him back along the street, beating at him with
dirty little hands, and though he felt dreadfully
ashamed and hurt, it was better than being
fetched by Marget herself. “Grandpa” added
zest to the children’s lives, gave them a sense
of drama, a heady taste of power. Their days
would lack a certain excitement when Marget’s
bone was gone.... In the end he gave up the
bridge as he had yielded the wall, because the
pleasure was not worth the risk. The river under
the bridge was not his own river, after all.
Safe in his mind he had it where he liked it best,
pale on the brown waste as it swam to sea.</p>

<p>There were other things strange to him in
Marget’s house, besides the absence of room
and peace. He found, for instance, that he
could not love the tables and chairs. He could
not even love his rickety bed, which carried
him homeward when he slept, and was the stall
to his fairyland through the trees. Certainly
he could not love Marget’s pots, which were
never whole or clean, or the kettle which poured
boiled cockroaches from its spout. Nor could
he like the propped-up chests of drawers into
which it was never safe to put a hand, for fear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
of upright needles or relics of bacon fat. It
was not wise to look too closely at the kitchen
sink or into the few battered pans used by the
children in their play. The clock was stuffed
with rags and boots, and had a sinister face
which he disliked. The oilcloth on the stairs
was full of holes.</p>

<p>Of course, he did not hate the things just
because they were old. The house on the marsh,
as Agnes knew, had been very neglected before
the last. The old things around him were
falling to pieces under his eyes, but they were
not being kicked and battered to their end.
They were really old, peacefully grown old, not
abused into miserable age before their time.
There were dust and cobwebs and broken
furniture and torn clothes, but the sun or the
wind was cleansing the place every hour. There
was no dirt in dark corners or refuse under
the stairs. There were no slimy walls or messes
in doubtful pots. In the old chests of drawers
were no mysteries save those that a tidy old
woman’s hands had folded away. The things
had been lovable in that house, because in spirit
they were clean. They had lived an honest
life, and they were not dying an obscene death.
Always about the furniture lingered the sweetness
of the tree.</p>

<p>Perhaps he might have grown fond of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
own chair, but then he never had a chair of his
own. Marget’s chairs were as restless as herself;
you never found them twice in the same place.
And age, as Kit very quickly learned, was last
and behind that in that house. If he happened
to show a liking for a seat, he was sure to be
ousted by some elbowing child. Quite soon he
learned to wait until the rest had settled down,
and to fit his old bones into anything that was
left. Only Bob, when he was at home, would
find his father the most comfortable chair.</p>

<p>He had no place at the table, either, and he
was always served last, and sometimes Marget
seemed to forget him and he had to go without.
Even when she chose to remember, he could
not always eat what she had cooked. That
meant that he was hungry most of the time,
and because he was hungry the time was very
long.</p>

<p>He had come to the cottage, as Thomas knew,
without any bitterness in his heart. Leaving
the farm had meant the end of all things, of
course, but as long as he wasn’t bitter there
was room for hope, and he had always been
able to beautify what he touched. Never once,
even in his mind, had he reproached Thomas
for condemning him to this. Thomas would
have helped him, had it been possible, he felt
sure. The lads were all good lads, alive or dead,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
and there had never been anything wrong
between him and them. Marget made a point
of telling him very soon that Thomas could
have saved him if he had liked, but it passed
Kit by like a wasp in a gale of wind. She was
always abusing Thomas and Kit’s old friends
on the marsh. All the things that were wrong
about him came solely from living on the marsh.
They were a low lot down there, so Marget
said, living like savages all the week, and only
at market seeing their fellow-men. They bred
wastrels and do-nowts like himself, cracked on
fiddling and the like, whom other folk had to
keep in their last years. And again she would
harp on Thomas and his crime, but she never
succeeded in making him understand. Her talk
about the marsh and its folk conveyed nothing
to old Kit. It was like somebody talking of a
country they had never seen.</p>

<p>And such a little kindness would have made
him content. He was away so much in his
own mind that he did not need very much from
the folk with whom he lived. And instead of a
little kindness he had had a great deal. Women
had thought for his comfort all his life, children
had always run to him before; and it took him
a long time to grasp that things were changed.
He had come into the cottage with a trustful
smile, but his smile was one of the things that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
went first. He never forgot that first tempest
in Marget’s terrible voice, and the hostile looks
of her sly and peering brood. And yet the fact
that he could not love them had grown upon
him only by degrees. He had never lived with
poverty coupled with hate, and he could not
grasp its indications for long. But he never
learned to love any one of the crowd, any more
than he learned to love the chairs.</p>

<p>Bob was as kind as possible when he was at
home, but that was so seldom that he did not
count. Slack in everything else, he had at least
grown smart in keeping out of the way. Even
Marget, who knew the backways of truth as well
as anybody on earth, could not always discover
where he lied. So he was not often at hand to
come between his father and his wife, though
he stood up for the old man when he was there.
But under the roof where Marget ruled only
the strongest soul could call itself its own. Bob
seemed to fade, to be far-off in the little room
with the narrow walls, where Marget towered
to the ceiling and covered the whole floor. Yet
she was only a middle-sized woman, after all,
where he was six foot and broad, but a word
from her tongue was like a slap from a clout,
the look in her eye was like the dig of a pin.
Her scurrying slippers, flapping at her heels, left
no calm place where her footsteps had not been.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span></p>

<p>Because there was nothing to love, something
had gone out of the old man after a while. He
was polite and gentle, as he had always been,
but now he grew very quiet, as though a finger
was laid on his tongue. He did not always see
what was under his nose, and when he was spoken
to he did not always hear. He looked “lost,”
Marget said, and the word was truer than she
knew. Of course he had always “mooned,” as
she called it, all his life, but behind the mooning
the vital spark was plain. His mind was off on
its travels, but it was sharply alive, and when
it came back it brought with it fire from Heaven.
But now there was no winged spirit behind his
eyes. He lived in his dreams, but they never
came down to earth.</p>

<p>Thomas, in one of his rare calls, noticed the
difference without knowing what it meant.
“The old man’s not as lish as he was,” he said to
himself, watching his father with a troubled
frown. “Likely it’s just he’s getting up in
years.... Going that seldom I’m bound to
see a change....” But years should have
meant nothing to Kit, as he was vaguely aware.
At the farm the old man would have remained
a happy child, even to the last minute of his
dying bed. Thomas pushed the worry to the
back of his mind, but though he could not
define the difference, he knew the cause. It was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
Marget who had smothered that long-lived spirit
of youth.</p>

<p>Even with her hand pressing upon it, it had
taken months to die. It had never really
flickered out until he had ceased trying to find
one of them to love. He had tried each of them
in turn, from the rating, jibing mother herself to
the red-haired baby screaming on the hearth, and
then he had suddenly let them all go. Perhaps
it might never have died at all if Marget had
allowed him to play his fiddle from time to time,
but it was the first part of him at which she
struck. The sound of it seemed to send her out
of her mind, and even the baby greeted it with
yells. Certainly, its unearthly, quivering note,
peculiarly thin and sweet, made an almost
heart-breaking wail in the little house. He did
his best to obey, but it was a long time before
he learned to keep his fingers from the strings.
Often he found himself playing without knowing
that he had begun, and awoke to a chorus of
abuse and screams. He would play in the night,
too, forgetting that it was night, and then even
the neighbours would start knocking at the
walls. There was always music singing in his
mind, so that he did not always know when the
fiddle was singing, too. He used to wonder,
when they made so much to-do, how it was
they did not hear the other music as well.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
But even the red-haired baby did not seem
to hear that. Anyhow, if it did, it did not
scream.</p>

<p>When he found that he could not play in the
house, he tried to find somewhere to play outside—down
by the river, for instance, close to
the bridge. He had a rather wonderful time
down there until Marget scented him out.
Sitting on a great root at the water’s edge, he
would play to the forest above and the forest
beneath, until folk came along walking through
the one, while their reflections walked through
the other, down below. They used to seat
themselves on the tree-trunks near or stand about
him in groups, while he played them varsovianas
and schottisches and reels. Of course there were
always children, but others came as well, and
sometimes there was quite a crowd. The music
would run to the village across the fields, though
never as far as Marget’s open door. But over
the river and up the park it went as far as it
liked, and as far as it liked with the river down
to the sea. On the grass at the river’s edge the
sun threw patches never twice alike, and the
listening faces looked paler under the trees.
Kit, in his old clothes, was just a bit of the trunk
on which he leaned, except for the flying movements
of his hands. Beside him was the velvety
water, deep black, shot and shivered by gold<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
patines and leaf-dances and lacy patterns and
bright gleams.</p>

<p>Sometimes, when he was tired, he talked to
the crowd, telling them of old dances and melodies
and old times. They left the tree-trunks, and
came nearer by degrees, the lads with their
hands in their pockets and the children with
fingers in their mouths. He looked round at
their friendly eyes, and thought how nearly all
eyes changed when a fiddle was played. If
anybody laughed or jeered at first, he was an
open or a sneaking worshipper before long.
Sometimes the women who lived near brought
him a cup of tea and a snack to eat, and
nothing he ever had at Marget’s heartened him
half so much. And on especially blessed days
when the tunes went like so much unwound
silk, there came somebody who remembered
Fiddlin’ Kit.</p>

<p>It was after one of these days, taking him
clean back to happier times, that he brought a
horrible vengeance on himself. One afternoon,
when the children were coming home from
school, he went out to the forbidden footpath
under the chestnuts and played. He forgot all
about the cottage just across, and Marget of the
music-hating heart. He forgot that he was
only a beggar-man and that somebody paid his
keep. He only remembered that he was Fiddlin’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
Kit, at sight of whom folk had always danced,
and the feet of the children stirred his ancient
blood. The young feet, the feet of the coming
generation of dancers, always stirred his blood.
From the end of the village they came skipping
down the road, singing a little tune they had
learned in school. Most of them came in twos
and threes, linked together by twining arms, or
trailing a little cloak by its hem in the dust.
Some whispered great mysteries in others’ ears.
Some held a little school on the kerb, as if they
had not already had enough, and in the midst
of the lesson gathered themselves up and ran.
And all the time, here and there, some of them
sang, and the tune that they sang got into the
fiddle and played. Kit, down the long perspective
of the street, saw the white school from which
they had come, and the tune, as it were, coming
with them out of the door. He had known the
song long ago, and he never forgot a tune. It
was only in nature that the fiddle should sing,
too.</p>

<p>Marget, staring crossly at neglected plants in
the ill-treated patch behind the house, heard
both fiddle and voices lilting over the roof.
They climbed the slates and swung off the
chimney-tops to drop in delicate sweetness on
her head. She thought of Kit, of course, in
the first breath, but remembered that she had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
left him nodding in the house. The red-haired
baby, she knew, had had him under its eye.
She glanced suspiciously down the cottage
backs, wondering which harboured this nuisance
to the rest. The Martin boy had a fancy for
fiddling, she believed; she had caught him
talking to Kit about it in the road. Then there
was that lass of Simpson’s that thought she
played—the one that was going to service before
so long. Folks never seemed to care whether
the neighbours liked the noise, though they were
fit to swear if the red-haired baby cried. There
was more than one that she wanted a word with
about that, a word flung in like a bomb at a
cottage door. This dratted fiddling might give
her her excuse, so she picked up her vegetables
and hurried down.</p>

<p>She thought of Kit again as she flapped along,
and again told herself that it was somebody
else. He was safe enough under her thumb,
by now, the silly old man. He had given
her a deal of trouble at first, fiddling in
other folks’ houses when he might not fiddle in
hers, but of course she had easily traced him by
the sound. Then she had stolen upon him unawares,
breaking the harmonies like so much
silvered glass, and after a time or two he had
never done it again. Besides, this playing came
from the street, and if she was sure of anything<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
she was sure she had cured him of that. It was
much more likely to be some fiddling tramp,
who would be knocking for ha’pence at her door.
She slipped as she ran down the steps to give
him the best of her tongue, and the potatoes
flew out of her apron left and right. It took her
some minutes to pick them up again, and as she
was doing so the music changed. Now it was
playing a dismal little tune, and little voices
began to sing it in breathless little jerks. On
the top of the tune she heard laughter and
applause, and then fiddle and voices went on
their way alone. Puzzled, she scrambled up
with grubby hands, bunched the potatoes in
her grimy apron and opened the cottage door.</p>

<p>The old man stood on the footpath under the
trees, his ear bent to the fiddle as he played.
His eyes, looking gravely before him at the
scene, were as intent as if the fate of nations
hung on his bow. The street was full of folk as
far as she could see, and in the midst of them
the children were playing “London Bridge.”
Under the trees and over the sun-flecked road
they moved slowly and solemnly to the tune,
and between the laughing folk on either side
their faces looked serious and sad. There were
babies among them, for this is the little children’s
game, and even the babies’ faces were sad.
They stood facing each other in rows across the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
street, keeping themselves up by the grasp of
their little hands. Sometimes they lost their
balance and fell down, but they were so intent
on the game that even as they bumped their
faces never changed. Suddenly Marget discovered
some of her own offspring in the crowd,
and that the younger ones were even taking
part. Last of all she saw the red-haired baby
among the rest, clenching determined fists and
setting a firm mouth.</p>

<p>Marget made a rush as soon as she got her
breath, but the crowd closed in before her and
held her back. She could see the smiling faces
all along the street, people staring over the
shoulders of others or peering over their heads,
leaning out of upstairs windows and sitting
along the wall. There were even faces peeping
down from the trees, and drawn up close to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
the kerb was the Squire’s carriage and pair.
The horses’ heads were turned away from the
scene, but the Squire and his wife were leaning
over the hood. Even the coachman was screwing
his neck as far as it would go, and as for the
footman, he had forgotten himself right out,
and had turned about and was kneeling on the
seat. And in the midst of the smiles and amusement
and applause the babies bobbed and moved
with never a smile, and the old man played as if
he played before kings.</p>

<p>It was the first and only time that Marget’s
children got anywhere near his heart. Even
the elder ones had forgotten to be cross and
ugly under the spell of the game. They laughed
and skipped as they watched, and sang the tune
and clapped their hands with the rest. As for
the red-haired baby, Kit’s eyes followed it all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
the time. He had given up the red-haired baby
latest of all, and now it seemed he had captured
it at last. It seemed to him for the first
time to have a look of his own babies, who were
either dead or lost in the likenesses of men.
He watched it stumbling over its own feet and
taking headers over its dirty gown. In the house
it would have screamed until it choked, but now
it picked itself up without a sound, and the
solemn intensity never left its face. He watched
it tail up behind the rest until it was circled by
the gaolers’ arms, and saw its eyes widen as
sentence was pronounced.</p>

<p>The fiddle shivered and halted and the tune
nearly broke. It seemed to him suddenly a
rather cruel little game. It was not a game,
really, but a memorial to a tradition—the
tradition that the foundation-stones of London
Bridge had been sprinkled with the blood of
little children. The babies were right who
treated it as drama and not play. Ever since
the beginning of the world children had been
martyrs in some cause, and in the little song
was the sound of all that they had suffered
through the years. When the fiddle jarred the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
enchantment halted, too, and into the red-haired
baby’s face came panic fright. It was at that
moment that Marget broke through the crowd
and snatched it into her arms.</p>

<p>The babies tumbled about her as if she had
struck them down, flung out of the magic, bewildered
and alarmed. Some of them burst
into loud sobs, and even above Marget’s voice
came the red-haired baby’s cries. She hustled
the crowd right and left with a fierce arm, that
seemed mighty enough to push even the Squire’s
carriage out of the way. Coachman and footman
were already mere liveried backs, with a
couple of crested buttons winking in the sun.
“Making such a stir in front o’ folks’ doors,”
Marget said, “and keeping the poor barns from
their tea an’ all! It was a pity folks hadn’t
summat better to do than to go dancing and
singing like a German band. But there was no
sense o’ decency in yon wastrel she and her
husband had to keep. You might as well keep
a dancing bear and ha’ done wi’ it right out!”</p>

<p>She reached Kit where he stood with a dropped
bow, and caught hold of his arm with an angry
pull. He moved mechanically at her touch,
and was dragged away to the house without
looking at her once. His head swam with the
violent flow of her speech and the shrieks of the
baby flung across her arm. Once he shrank,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
hearing a giggle out in the crowd. But the
Squire thanked him by name as he went by.</p>

<p>It passed, of course—all that vast and returning
storm which followed these mistakes, shaking
the house like a powder-mill gone up, until the
frightened neighbours hammered at the walls.
He left behind him at last the shock and shame
of that afternoon, forgetting it in the healing
of his dreams. But for a time he kept a faint
affection for the red-haired baby who had entered
so passionately into his game, and at first it
seemed to be attracted to him, too. It would
clutch itself on to its feet by the help of his
knee, and stand staring at him with great,
demanding eyes, as if asking him for the magic
they had made together in the street. It even
tried to play the game by itself, mopping and
mowing in its trailing skirt, but the fiddle never
came to its aid, and very soon it ceased to ask.
It forgot to lift up wondering, seeking eyes, by
which even the dirtiest baby may win a heart,
and became again the chief terror of the house.
Always, that is, excepting Marget herself. But
then Marget’s terror was on a plane of its own.
The red-haired baby, at least, was human in
its misdeeds, but Marget was elemental, inhuman
as packing ice.</p>

<p>And yet, even after the link with the baby
had gone, a touch of feeling for Marget stayed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
with Kit. He had had a glimpse of her while
it stood in the gaolers’ hands, and the game had
begun to harrow its little soul. Marget had
looked as perhaps those other mothers had
looked, as mothers always look in the grip of
the great fear.... While he remembered it,
he saw her with different eyes.</p>

<p>But even that attempt at sympathy went
the way of the rest at last. Marget was as open-handed
with her smacks as she was open-mouthed
with abuse, and the red-haired baby came in
for the hardest smacks of all. He watched long
enough for that glimpse to come again, but it
never did. He was one of those who make
angels out of a passing smile, and even to Marget
he looked to show a wing. But the feet of even
his wandering trust had struck a blind alley
at last, and, seeing the face of her daily life,
he forgot the look that had made him drop
his bow.</p>

<p>It was shortly after this, too, that the Persecution
of the Fiddle began, leaving him little time
for dreams or anything else. All his life the
fiddle had been secure as the Lady riding
through Ireland in her gems, but it was in peril
in a robber-country now. On the marsh he had
never been afraid to lay it down where he chose,
on table or chair, in the garden or the hedge-side.
Somebody was sure to bring it back if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
it was lost, and nobody ever dreamed of doing
it harm. Sometimes his own dog fetched it
home, without as much as a scratch on the
shining wood, and once a butcher had seen it
in the grass, and turned his horse with it on the
road he had come. And there was a tale that a
great musician had found it on the shore, and
taken it far out and played it on the sands.
Kit could never be persuaded to speak of that,
because it was the nearest thing to stealing that
had come the fiddle’s way. Besides, he had an
idea that it was never afterwards quite the same.
There was a certain un-English fierceness in
the lower notes, an occasional puzzling wildness
in the higher. It had gained something rather
wonderful and strange, but it seemed to him
that it had lost something, too. Still, the fiddle
itself had come back safe to the farm, with a
little note of thanks that was signed by a famous
name.</p>

<p>He kept his trick of confidence for months
after he arrived at Marget’s house. The fiddle
came down with him in the morning when he
rose, and during the day might be found anywhere
at all, from the door-mat to the mantelpiece
or the flowerless flower-box on the sill.
It was a miracle that it escaped being thrown on
the fire, or stamped to pieces under the children’s
feet. There were occasional terrible moments<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
when it really disappeared, and nobody would
help him in the search. Once it was away from
him for a whole night, and he sat on his bed in
the dawn, and was wholly uncomforted by his
magic tree. But he did not believe that it was
lost, and he was right, for during the morning a
neighbour brought it timidly to the door. He
learned to be careful, however, after that, and
seldom let the fiddle out of his hands.</p>

<p>But now Marget announced boldly that she
meant to destroy it before she was done. Perhaps
she was really ashamed because her father-in-law
had fiddled in the street; she had so
little of any other shame that at least there was
plenty to spare. Perhaps it was just a natural
hate of a beautiful thing beyond her ken, or a
grudge for that touch of terror in the red-haired
baby’s face. In any case, she meant to steal the
fiddle as soon as she could, and make an end of
it before his eyes. She let the children share in
this pleasant game, offering a reward, and
setting them to catch him off his guard. She
could not take the fiddle from him by force,
because in spite of his age he would have given
her a hard fight. Besides, there was as much
pleasure in the promise of the crime as there
could possibly be in the crime itself. She was
always hinting at plots that couldn’t help but
succeed, and her nods and winks to the grinning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
fry turned the old man cold. Her provisions
for the doom of the fiddle were various in the
extreme. She would burn it ... break it in
pieces with the axe ... crucify it on the
kitchen door. She would give it to the ragman
to take away in a bag, or to the children to bury
in the field. She would fling it into the barrel
out at the back, and they would all stand
round and watch it sink and drown. “And
what’ll Gran’pa do wi’ his daft self then?”
she would ask of the children with meaning
smiles, while Kit sat still before an untouched
plate. The children would echo her words
and nudge each other and laugh, and he
would clutch the fiddle under the table until it
spoke.</p>

<p>In the dark well where it was so difficult to
see he felt always about him creeping fingers
and prying eyes. In the narrow room which
had neither corners nor dreaming-places for the
old, there seemed always a host of spies that
crouched and peered. When he drowsed in
spite of himself on a hot afternoon, he would
start awake to find stealthy hands grasping at
the treasure on his knee. Instinct told him, as
a rule, when the enemy was about, but sometimes
the fiddle warned him with a speaking
string. He used to think that it knew its danger
as well as he; but of course it didn’t do to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
trust to that. Small wonder he learned to take
it with him in his dreams!</p>

<p>He thought once of asking Thomas to take it
away, so that at least it would be safe from Marget
and her gang. This was on one of the days
when his fear was more than he could bear,
when the hints and nudges had over-tried his
mind. What troubled him most was the thought
of the fiddle being drowned. He pictured it at
the bottom of the barrel in the dark, a choked
and silenced creature rotting out of reach. He
saw himself, armed with a stick, everlastingly
trying to drag it up, and for ever watching it
drift down again to die. It would be like seeing
some singing-bird thrust under to drown, not
once, but many times before it sank. At least
it would have a chance of life if it was given away;
it might hear itself speak, might even come to be
loved. And if they broke it to bits, at least it
would die quick, but he could not endure that
rotting by degrees. He would find it hard to
sleep when they took it away, but if it lay in the
barrel how could he sleep at all? So when
Thomas, after his duty visit, rose to go, the old
man followed him out into the street. In the
dark he felt the fiddle thrust into his hands,
and listened dully to the hurried request. “I’ll
see to it, never fret,” he said, when he understood,
and moved away with the fiddle under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
his coat; but he hadn’t gone far before Kit
was at his side, begging in anxious tones to have
it back. So master and fiddle returned together
to the house of hinting and spies. He said to
himself that they might take it from him if
they could; at least he could never bring himself
to send it away.</p>

<p>When Marget had her will of them both at
last, it was his habit of old time that delivered
them into her hands. A man from the marsh
came along the street and hailed Kit through
the window as he passed, and Kit rose and ran
out as if an angel had beckoned through the
pane. Marget heard him chattering in the street,
and found the fiddle lying on a chair. He did
not see her or even feel her near, stooped like a
vulture over its watched-for prey. The strings
jarred together as she took the fiddle up, but he
never heard them or even turned his head. He
went on talking and laughing in the street long
and long after the fiddle had disappeared....</p>

<p>The week that followed was just seven days
and nights blotted clean out of his tale of life.
He never spoke of his loss, nor did he even begin
to make a search. He said nothing even in the
first shock of finding the fiddle gone. He just
stood and stared at the chair where it had lain
as one stares at a shell where the spirit has once
been. The sense of irrevocable loss was as clear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
about the chair as about the heedless dead with
their shuttered eyes. Kit had always been
queer about furniture, as Thomas knew, and
one of Marget’s unmeaning chairs said something
to him at last.</p>

<p>He did not know whether he spoke or ate
during that dead week, but for the most part
he was silent and refused his food. Still, his
absent-mindedness was an old tale by now, so
Marget got little satisfaction out of that. The
only difference was that he would not sit in the
kitchen any more, and no amount of abuse
could fetch him back. Perhaps he was afraid
of the chair that was like a coffin in his eyes;
at all events, he refused to sit in it again. Instead,
he sat in his bedroom on his bed, staring
for ever at his magic tree. But there was no
magic about it now, because the fiddle had gone
away, and without it the fairy glades would
never let him in. Yet still he sat there, staring
and staring, while the sun climbed the morning
hills, touched the house in passing with a golden
wing, and fled away to break into colours in
the west. Always he sat with his fingers lightly
clasped, as if something were lying within them
on his knee.</p>

<p>So, as it happened, Marget found her vengeance
a poor thing, after all. The scene that she had
looked for hung fire and never came off. There<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
was nothing exciting in the way of pleading and
tears; nothing, in fact, except this absolute
blank, risen like a fog between her victim and
herself. Even the children felt that the situation
had fallen flat. Instead of “carrying on,”
as they had hoped, Gran’pa had been as dull as
a dead fish. He hadn’t even spoken, nor did he
mean to speak. He had not given them any
sort of scope for their peculiar powers. Why,
you might almost have thought that he didn’t
even know!</p>

<p>Marget began to brag of her guilt at last, but
it was impossible to tell whether he took it in.
He did not seem to notice her vivid accounts
of how the fiddle had met its end. Sometimes
she was exasperated into contradicting her own
tales, but as none of them seemed to reach him
that did not matter very much. She was chiefly
puzzled, however, because he never tried to get
the fiddle back. The cheerful hide-and-seek
that she had planned couldn’t be played because
the principal person concerned in it wouldn’t
take part. He never went to the water-butt
to peer into its depths. He never poked about
the ashheap or raked the fire. He did not even
dig about the garden, as if hoping to find it
among the flowers. He knew Marget would
never give it as clean a burial as that. All
that he did was to shut himself up and stare,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
until even she began to feel uneasy in her mind.
It would be a poor victory if he was too crushed
to care, and in any case she did not want him
helpless on her hands. Daft as he was, he was
of use to her sometimes, a caretaker for the
house when she wanted to be out, a stick to
frighten importunate beggars, a hodman to lift
a load; and always a peg upon which to hang
her tongue. If she drove him clean crazed, he
would be a greater burden than before, and
certainly it looked as though that might be the
end. So it came about that, after a week,
there was a miracle for which he had not even
prayed.</p>

<p>He was sitting as usual on his bed, holding
between his hands the thing that wasn’t there,
when down in the kitchen he suddenly heard
its voice. He hardly knew it at first—it was so
raucous and strange, a voice that wept and
screamed, and tried to keep silence but was
forced to speak, and was like to destroy itself
with its own rage; yet in all its wrath and pain
it was still the voice he loved. He tried to get
up to go to its help, but even the beginning of
the miracle held him chained. He could only
sit still and tremble ... and wonder and
wait....</p>

<p>The children were all together downstairs,
and one of them had the fiddle under his chin,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
while the red-haired baby, in its trailing skirt,
mopped and mowed in the forgotten game.
Some of the magic had come back, in spite of
the fiddle’s terrible voice. They laughed and
clapped as they had done in the street, and the
baby’s face was exalted and set. Even the
fiddler had a shadow of Kit’s dignity and poise.
There was an air of innocent joy strange in the
dingy room, a faint recalling of beauty once
perceived. Marget, coming in on the little
scene, found herself outside it and shut off.
There was no part for her in the play they had
learned from the daft old man, who knew no
better than to go fiddling in the street. All her
fierce jealousy was aroused by this faithfulness
to his little moment’s power. It seemed to her,
watching, that he stood between the children
and herself, teaching them something she couldn’t
learn, and taking them where she could not go.
For every mother there is a Piper drawing her
child away, as even Marget was coming to
understand. Perhaps she had seen his reflection
in the red-haired baby’s face, and suddenly
saw it again now. In any case, she brought the
show to an end, clouting both player and dancer
over the head, and making away with the fiddle
up the stair. Through this enveloping cloud
Kit heard the door burst open at his back, and
saw a shining thing flung quivering on the bed.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
He did not move until she had banged out once
more, and then after a long while he turned
and put out a hand ... found shape and touch
just as they had been, and a sweet answer from
every string....</p>

<p>There flashed back on him at once all his
vision and his peace. The tree stood up again
in the midst of wonderland, and on either side
of it the world was wide. His link with its
golden solitude was renewed, so that it was his to
wander in when he would. And after a while,
when the first relief was past, his mind went off
down the road that led to the sea.</p>

<p>Always, until they took the fiddle from him,
he had been able to see the marsh when he chose,
the broad, flat stretches and the clean, soft
lines. There, where his mind went, was no
muddle of mortar and folks. There was no
street with the houses crouching cheek by jowl,
muttering secrets into each other’s ears; houses,
where strange faces looked in, where dust blew in
from the road, where nobody was securely still
and safely alone. Here, nobody died or was
born, or suffered and rebelled, but the whole
street knew and put it into words; but out
there none of these things kept one ever on
guard. Nobody heeded one’s secrets but the
sea, and that never told until it gave up its
dead. And the sea never heeded, however folk<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
behaved. One could run there, while here one
could only walk, could shout and sing without
troubling the police; while the strains of a
fiddle crying out its soul were as free as a gull
crying behind a boat.</p>

<p>There was always sun for him when he
thought of the marsh, the early-evening sun on
road and field. It lay in a great, golden sheet,
unbroken as always on a western marsh, stretching
out to the far line of the sea. No matter
how it rained in the street, in his mind that
walked on the marsh there was always sun.
The shadows were barely out, and never conquered
the gold. And through it along the white
road he came to his home.</p>

<p>But often he lingered so long on the road that
his mind never reached its goal. The journey
alone was an adventure in itself, full of things
that could not be missed. There were always
growing things to see in the dykes, marsh-buttercups
on some pool, purple vetches on
some hedge. Somewhere a farm would stand
up between its orchard and fields, and meet
him always with a new surprise. Houses never
outstared you on the marsh, for all its long distances
and unbroken sweep. They grew upon
you by degrees, coming, yet keeping themselves
in reserve, like faces peeping welcome round a
porch. Even his own home on the sand’s edge,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
alone on its shooting tongue of land, stood back
in a shelter of fence and tree. In spite of its
outstanding position, it was yet serenely aloof.
It had the withdrawn unconsciousness of well-bred
folk, an unawareness of alien eyes. You
might stare at it all day long and it would not
blink. At Marget’s you were always conscious
of the street outside.</p>

<p>Sometimes he did reach the farm and go in,
and on those days he was a long time coming
back. Often he never passed the meadow gate,
but once through that he did not turn until he
had reached the house itself. The gate was
troublesome to open because of its broken bars,
and even in his mind he found it hard to move.
Even in his mind he was tired by the time he
got to the gate, and so he often stayed on the
near side. He could see the house from there
plainly enough, and it was always ready when
he wished to go in. Things waited for him until
he came that way again. The light stayed level
and golden on the evening land. The face of
the house was steadfast in its peace. No need
to hurry and force himself if he was tired. It
would always be ready for him when he
came.</p>

<p>On the days when he did go in he went with
a rush, as if he had jumped the distance that
lay between. He went with the whole of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
energy and desire unwasted by the sweetness
of the way. There he was, through the meadow
and the wicket-gate and the house door, and the
miracle was accomplished that brought him
home. All the shadows and dim places of the
house rested his eyes, and hinted of folks who
had never gone away. The scent of his own
place was rich with his memories of the past,
tangible things that asked for his hand upon
their heads. The house was full of that special
surprise which belongs to the things we know
by heart; the colour and shape of them ...
the feel of suddenly-opened doors ... the
gleam of a brass handle, the shallowness of a
step, the forgotten pattern of some ancient
stuff. A sense of coolness in a certain room, or
of sun, or of firelight on a hearth; atmospheres
as full of meaning as if lavender had been
stirred. It was strange how you saw things
wrong when you were living in a house. You
had to leave and go back to it to know.</p>

<p>Of course there were people in the house,
but they never spoke to him or he to them. He
saw them sitting and talking or going about
their work, but he never heard them speak.
They never looked at him, either, as he went
about. If they had lifted their eyes to look at
him he might have been afraid. But as long as
they did not look he could watch them in peace,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
the folk who had all been part of his own life.
His parents were there, his brothers and sisters,
his wife and his three sons. The same person at
all ages was there, just as he himself was there
at every age, so that the house was full and rich
and warm. He never thought of it as it was
when he left, a chilly case for a wailing violin.
As soon as he had gone he filled it again with
all who had a right within its walls, and wandered
among them, quietly content. He could not
touch them or hear their voices or meet their
eyes, but he did not want to do any of these
things. He could leave the house as it was
with only a little ache, but he could not have
left pleading looks and hands.</p>

<p>Even on the days when he went into the house
he did not always go upstairs, because it meant
going too near the dividing-line of which he
was afraid. More often, he sauntered through
the rooms below, into the sudden whiteness of
the dairy or the still little parlour shut like a
Sabbath book. Through every window as he
passed, a picture flashed that was old to him
and yet strange. He saw each of them now as
if mounted and set in a frame. Things changed
about the house to match his memories as they
came, but they never passed beyond a certain
point, and every one of them was mellow and
sweet with time. Looking back, he saw nothing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
that struck him as being new. It was all much
too beautiful for that.</p>

<p>When he did get to the bedroom at last, there
was always shadow there. He went into the
shadow as he went up the stair, and met it
when he opened the door. Through the windows,
when he looked out, there was no sun on the
marsh, only the faint rising of a moon. Somewhere
out in the uncertain dark was the quiet
plashing of the sea. It was the hour when the
world is nothing and some one person is all;
when Heaven comes easily, and earth as easily
goes. So would death come, he thought, his
own good death. Some day he would enter the
house for the last time, and climb the stair and
open and shut the door. Through the shadows
for the last time he would see the things stand
out that they had shared, and that perhaps
they might find again on the other side. The
bits of carpet that their feet had worn; the bed
where they had heard each other’s breathing in
the night; handles and hooks that hand after
hand had touched. The sea would be there for
the last time, because in Heaven there would
be no sea. He would lean out to it, but would
only hear it, silver and cool. Then he would
let himself summon her out of the dark, because
now there would be no need of turning back,
and however she came she would be just right,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
whether fresh and young or grey and wrinkled
and bowed. They would put out their arms to
each other, and find each other there....
Death, that seemed so dreadful to folk, meant
only that.</p>

<p>His dreams grew upon him after the fiddle
came back, chiefly because now he very seldom
went out. He could not walk very far, and no
matter where he went, it was sure to be against
the rules. He was forbidden the other houses
in the row, and the river-bank and his potterings
on the footpath by the wall. If he went out at
all, it was on an errand of Marget’s to the shops,
but he had lost the wish to go out, just as he
seemed to have lost the wish to play. In these
days his fingers never went unknowingly to
the strings. Even now that the fiddle was safe,
he went on sitting in his room, and for some
unstated reason Marget let him be. So his
mind was often away on its travels over the
marsh, and the body that was left grew quieter
every day. The time seemed to be getting near
for that last mounting of the stairs. Those who
saw him about then said that he “wouldn’t be
so long.”</p>

<p>And now, after all the days, had come the
order of release. Thomas had got the farm in
the end, and straight away asked for his father
to come home. Not only his mind but his body<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
could go to the place for which he cried. He
could go to a son who would ease his remaining
days and a daughter awaiting him with open
arms. Of course he was glad to be going, thankful
beyond words; too thankful and anxious,
indeed, for his content. He could have taken
it simply and easily, earlier on, but after all
this time it loomed too large. Before, it would
have been inevitable and right, but now it seemed
to him more than a little strange. As he sat
waiting for them to come and take him away,
he was conscious of the discomfort and even
terror of change. He felt both the reluctant
weariness of the old—for whom every shift on
the road may be the last—and the fear of the
dreamer that his dream may prove untrue.
The idealist always shrinks from fulfilment just
at the last, and Kit was shrinking and suffering
all through. He dreaded the emotional strain
through which he would have to pass, longing
with shame for his wretched bed and the quiet
communion with his tree. Nevertheless he
reached forward eagerly to his dream, knowing
that he must accept it now, even if he slew both
it and himself. Steadily, at the back of his
mind, shone the golden glory of the marsh.</p>

<p>He sat patiently, as the old sit who have to
husband their strength, but he was filled with a
feverish aching to be off. His nervous energy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
ebbed continually during this long pause before
the start. He had a miserable fear that he might
refuse to go when it came to the point. He saw
himself making for his room as soon as the trap
appeared, an obstinate, desperate old animal
slinking to its lair. Marget would curse and
hammer on the door, and he would cower on the
bed in silence, holding his breath. When they
were tired of it they would leave him alone,
and his heart would stop shaking itself out of
its place. He would hear the trap drive away
out of his life, and know in that instant all that
he had missed....</p>

<p>He might have steadied his nerves by dozing
in his chair, but the children, as usual, kept
him from doing that. All the time they were
darting in and out to look for the trap, or peering
at him round the doors. All about the dark
cottage he could see their eyes, excited, curious,
mocking and bold. He could hear them speaking
of him in rough whispers that always reached
him as jeers. For once he wished them busy at
their quarrelsome games, but they were much
too intent to take themselves out of the way.
The dramatic element in Gran’pa held them to
the last—the thing that hinted tragedy and
scenes. Even the act of driving away would
mean more with Gran’pa than with anybody
else. They felt instinctively that this was one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
of the climaxes of life, and responded eagerly
to its thrill. Gran’pa’s bundle in its red handkerchief
was also a source of thrill, a sort of
monster pudding in its cloth. Now and then
one of the children emerged and gave the bundle
a sly but searching poke. If Gran’pa hadn’t
been there, they would have had it open at once,
and there was always the chance that he might
leave it behind. So they stayed, impatient and
fidgety but firm, wearing the old man’s strength
with whisper and stare. There was more to be
got out of this than any casual play. Besides,
Marget’s concluding scene was still to make.</p>

<p>Now he had that first terrible feeling of being
suffocated and hemmed in. He couldn’t even
find a place to rest his eyes, because of the
pointing fingers bristling on all sides. There
seemed to be faces everywhere as well, and even
when he turned to the street one peered at him
over the sill. He would have got up and gone
outside, but he knew they were there to watch
him and would cry him down. Panting, he
fixed his hunted gaze on the stair, seeing it in
the dark room as a mysterious ladder climbing
into peace. It rested him just to look at it
and picture where it led. Up above, safe from
all the eyes, was a hiding-place for the hunted,
shrinking old. The desire to be there grew
upon him as he looked, so that he was drawn<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
irresistibly to his feet. Once up the narrow
stair, he would be free of the effort that lay
ahead, and the minds that had fastened on his
like preying teeth. Now he ached to be there,
burned to be there.... Something with wings
would stand outside the door.... He straightened
himself, nerving himself to move, and then
he saw Marget coming down the stairs.</p>

<p>The silence, breaking the children’s speech in
half, held a sense of something thrown from a
height and smashed. Something always died
or was hurt when Marget entered a room. Kit
had been too intent to heed her step, but now
she was there before him, blocking his way.
Where the presence with wings should have
been he saw Marget instead, thin, pallid, slatternly,
flaring-fringed and slit-eyed. Her tight
lips sneered when she saw the old man on his
feet, and her knuckles whitened as she gripped
the rail. He looked very tall in the low room,
and, with bundle and fiddle, very ready to be
gone. This was a bitter moment for Marget
that snatched her bone from between her teeth.
She was ragingly jealous of those who wanted
him for himself—wanted before they had tried
him, Marget said. They couldn’t really be glad
of a burden in the house; they were only pretending,
to make other folks look small. She
despised them for saddling themselves with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
old man, and hated and mocked them because
they did it with smiles. Also she hated Kit
for his evident eagerness to go.</p>

<p>“What d’ye think ye’re at?” she demanded,
looking down at him from the stair. Her malignant
face sneered at him out of the gloom, and
her voice was full of sounds that troubled his
delicate ear.</p>

<p>He braced himself, as he always did when
Marget spoke. Even when she looked at him
he held himself ready for attack. “Trap’ll be
round, waint it?” he asked, by way of reply.
He leaned his hand on the table to steady himself,
looking up. “I reckon trap’ll be round
afore so long.”</p>

<p>She glanced for a moment at his hand, finer,
in spite of its age, than any in the house, and
there came into her face that hatred of things
unknown which had stirred her to fury when the
baby danced.</p>

<p>“Nay, then, it just waint!” she rapped out.
“I told Bob he needn’t hurry himself, getting
off. They won’t be looking for you yet. Marsh-folk
is always a week behind everybody else.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be glad to be off,” Kit said dully, with the
mechanical patience he had learned at her
hands. “I’m getting weary a bit, hanging about.
I’d best be off.”</p>

<p>“Ay, well,” she jibed at him, “you’ll have to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
bide. I don’t know as another hour or two in
my house’ll do you any harm. You were glad
enough on it once, when landlord skifted you
out. And it’s as cheap sitting as standing, I
reckon, even for folks as hasn’t the price of a
seat. You’d best set down till it’s time for you
to stir.”</p>

<p>“Trap’ll be round,” Kit repeated doggedly.
“I’d reyther stand.” He drew in his fingers as
if her eyes hurt them, and did his best to straighten
his back and set his jaw. The deliverance
that was so near gave him courage to fight, in
spite of the sinister things in her face and voice.
He had yielded in almost every contest yet,
and if she had lost where the fiddle was concerned,
it was because she had been conquered
by something in herself. To sit was to own
himself beaten to the end, and would send him
shamed to the marsh from a last defeat. And
there was always the chance that if he sat he
might never get away, because of the shrinking
that wrought against him in his heart.</p>

<p>So again he braced himself and said, “I’ll
stand.”</p>

<p>She bent forward towards him from the stair,
her chin thrust out at him and her eyes nearly
shut. He wanted to push her away and hurry
out into the street. He had a feeling that she
had trodden that winged thing underfoot, so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
that there was no longer a refuge for him upstairs.</p>

<p>“I tellt you trap wouldn’t be round just yet.”</p>

<p>“Ay, but it will.”</p>

<p>“Likely you think I don’t know?”</p>

<p>“Nay, not I.” Kit looked away.</p>

<p>“I’m a liar, that’s what it is?”</p>

<p>“Nay.”</p>

<p>“Set down and bide.”</p>

<p>“I’ll stand.”</p>

<p>Suddenly she dropped her strained pose and
became all violence and storm, like the wind
that gets up out of nowhere on a silent night.
Raising herself with a jerk, she flapped down
the stair with the noise of a dozen carpet-beaters
in full swing. Nobody ever expressed
as much as Marget with a pair of down-trodden
slippers loose at the heels; yet nobody would
keep them when she was gone, pathetic and
reverenced by a bed.... Kit thought of his
winged thing she had beaten down, and looked
to see feathers scattered under her feet. Her
face was changed both in colour and shape by
the unknown terrible things that lived in her
brain. Her voice was changed in the same way,
and it was her voice that Kit dreaded most,
because his ear had the straighter run to his
soul. The things that were part of Marget yet
not Marget he never could understand. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
was never ready for them, never on his guard.
Now she was close to him, bent as if to strike, a
trick that had a special horror for the sensitive
old man. The children nudged each other and
laughed, gloating, yet more than half afraid.</p>

<p>“Stand, will ye—getting in folks’ road and
showing yourself that smart to be up and off?
Ay, I know you’re fain to be shot of us at last,
and you should be right shammed o’ suchlike
nastiness, I’m sure. Who’d ha’ seen to you all
this time if it hadn’t been for us? Thomas
wanted nowt wi’ you, as you know; he’d other
fish to fry, had Tom. You’d ha’ bin on the
parish, that’s where you’d ha’ bin, and like
enough in t’ Union itself. Yon’s the spot for
do-nowts as spend their own brass and then look
to spend other folks’ as well! Yon’s the spot
for wastrels and rattlehorns and fancy fiddlers
playing in the street. (Eh, but it banged owt,
did yon!) It’ll be queer if you don’t come to it
yet, wi’ a pound o’ baccy at Christmas, and
‘Thank ye kindly, master,’ all the week.
Likely they’ll set you going errands, tea and
currants and a bit o’ lard, or happen your
job’ll be cleaning out the pigs. Ay, you’ll land
there yet, as sure as eggs is eggs! Likely you’ll
think on a bit then about Bob and me.”</p>

<p>He stood looking at her without saying a word,
fascinated, just as the children were fascinated,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
by this exhibition of a ruthless mind. He could
feel them gathering closer, magnetised though
afraid. The voice that was full of strange
things filled all the house, flooded the street and
carried down the row, so that folks in passing
halted and stared, and the neighbours came
running to their doors. “She’ll do for him
yet,” they said to each other when they heard
that voice, and there was always the chance
that the moment had arrived.</p>

<p>“As for the spot you’re off to,” she flared
on, “I hope you’ll find it all you think for, I’m
sure. Thomas and his missis’ll likely be terble
throng wi’ you while you’re fresh, but wait till
they’ve had you to do for as long as me. Wait
till they’ve gitten you maundering about the
place, making a deal o’ work wi’ your daft-like
ways. Agnes Black’ll skift you pretty
sharp, or she’s not the woman I take her for,
that’s all.”</p>

<p>Still he said nothing, paralysed by the flood
of sound, and the fierce inflections springing out
of her voice like sparks from a cat’s back. And
then suddenly she changed her method of
attack, letting her voice slide down the scale
until it was even and chill and full of insidious
hints and something that smiled.</p>

<p>“You think it’ll be a soft spot, I’ll be bound,
wi’ nowt to do but set fiddling all day. You<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
reckon you’re going back to things as they was,
only wi’ other folk to see to the work instead o’
you. But if you’re counting on things being
just the same, you’re badly wrong. Nowt stands
still, and I reckon farms is like the rest. What,
I doubt you’ll not know the place when you set
eyes on it again! It’ll have changed a deal in
these last two years, same as you’ve changed a
deal yourself. Last man let it down pretty bad;
it’s a mercy he broke his neck afore so long.
Landlord’s had a deal to do at it, they say,
and Thomas is that set up he’s for doing a deal
more. Ay, it’ll not be the same farm, no more
than Kit Sill’s the same man. You’ll find it
out for yourself afore you’ve been there a week.
You’ll be nobbut a beggar there, you’ll think
on, same as here, and owe somebody every bite.
It’ll be another man’s roof over you, as used
to be your own. There’ll be another chap
master, telling you what’s what. There’ll be a
woman for missis as baint no wife o’ yours.
It’ll be bitter as salt water washing at your
door....”</p>

<p>“Ay, but it’ll be home,” Kit said bravely,
holding up his head, and wondering what devil
taught her his secret fear.</p>

<p>“Yon’s what you think—now.” For the
first time there was a touch of sincerity in her
voice. Her cold eyes looked away from him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
through the open door. “Them as gangs once
shouldn’t return. Going back doesn’t mend
things; it nobbut spoils what you’ve had. You’ll
likely spoil summat if you gang ... summat
you’ve fettled for yourself.... Your sort
doesn’t live in houses made wi’ hands....”</p>

<p>“Summat I’ve fettled?” Kit asked, and his
voice shook. “Houses not made wi’ hands...?”
He stared at her, terror and pleading in his face,
and she knew she had beaten him and turned
again with a jeer.</p>

<p>“Nay, I doubt there’s summat smittal about
daft folks like ye! I nobbut mean you’ll happen
wish yourself back wi’ Marget afore you’ve done.
Not that you’re off yet, so you can just set you
down. Folks wi’ manners wouldn’t be showing
themselves that smart.”</p>

<p>“I reckon I’ll stand.”</p>

<p>She shot out a furious hand, thin, with flat
finger-tips and curved nails. “Set down!” she
hissed, and he shrank back, but recovered himself
again and stood firm.</p>

<p>“I’ll stand.”</p>

<p>She made a step towards him until their faces
almost touched, putting such intensity into the
short approach that his strength seemed to ebb
from him consciously as he watched. She leaned
across the table willing him to obey. “You’ll
set down,” she said. “<em>You’ll set down!</em>” And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
suddenly he gave way as if pulled by a string,
crumpling into a shaking heap of bones. He sat
down slowly, grasping the fiddle so tight that it
hurt his hands, and very slowly the tears ran
down his face. For a moment longer she stayed
as she was, holding him with her eyes, terrible
as a Juggernaut in the way. And then the trap
came trundling down the street.</p>

<p>The spell broke at the sound of the wheels,
and at once the children were out at the door,
tumbling and fighting as they went. As soon
as the trap stopped they were round it like
flies, fretting the horse and settling on the step.
Marget caught the baby by its skirts as it
stumbled after the rest, and it set up one of its
stupendous howls. Only Kit stayed perfectly
still where he was, as if the strength had indeed
gone out of his limbs. The stage was set, but
the chief actor did not appear. Bob turned in
his seat and looked in at the door, and up at
his father’s window and gave a hail, but Kit
never showed that he heard him or tried to stir.
The tears ran down his face and he did not so
much as lift up a hand. Then Marget snatched
at his bundle and thrust it into his arms.</p>

<p>“Ay, well, then gang!” she said in a brutal
voice, and watched him tremble and totter to
his feet. The red-haired baby fought and shrieked
to be down, but she shook the breath out of it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
with a mighty jolt. Bob whistled and called
again, but the two in the house still looked at
each other and paid no heed. They had come
too close in that last clash to slip apart again
with ease. The hatred on both sides had its
mixture of fascination and fear. He felt a
helpless dread of a power that beauty could not
touch; she, an angry terror of genius out of
reach.</p>

<p>One of the children came running back to the
door, but still the old man did not move. It
seemed as though the leash in which Marget
held him had not been slipped. The moment
was here that began for him better things, but
he did not feel in the least as though the break
had come. The sense of relief he had looked
for did not ease his heart. She scowled, “Be
off with you, then,” turning away her head, but
still he stood without attempting to go, as motionless
as a stock. Never once did he even turn
and look out at the door. And then, “I’m
obliged to you, Marget,” he said at last; “I’m
obliged to you, Marget, for all you’ve done,”
and shifted the bundle to show a shaky hand.</p>

<p>She brushed it aside with a sharp elbow, but
the red came violently into her face. “I’ll be
bound you’re obliged!” she sneered, tossing
her head. “You’d ha’ been in Queer Street, I
reckon, but for us. Eh, well, I hope you’ll find<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
everything to your liking at the farm.” The
baby opened its mouth again, and she shut it
with a jerk. There was a pause, and then she
went on, her voice sounding hypnotised and
dragged. “You’ll mind you can come back if
you find as you can’t bide? I want nowt wi’
you, an’ that’s flat, but I reckon I can go on.
You’d be best to come back if you find as you
can’t bide....”</p>

<p>But now he had turned away and was looking
eagerly at the door, so that he scarcely seemed
to hear her final words. With that look he began
his journey to the marsh, to the sun on the long
levels that were all of them paths to home. He
moved, and at once his feet were over the
threshold and he found himself out in the street.
He had forgotten Marget as if she had never
been, though he had never noticed the snapping
of the cord. She did not follow him out, but
stayed at the door. The red-haired baby burst
into bitter tears.</p>

<p>The neighbours were all looking out along
the row, and a little crowd had gathered round
the trap. The children still quarrelled and
climbed and pushed each other down, or poked
and fidgeted the sleepy horse. The road was
like a river in the sun, golden beside the black
one under the trees, but both of them coming
ultimately to the sea. The light dazzled him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
as he went out, so that he could hardly see the
smiling faces and outstretched hands. Somebody
took the bundle from him and put it into
the trap, but when they offered to take the
fiddle he shook his head. A woman brought a
nosegay from a bush beside her door, and pinned
it laughingly in his coat. Another pushed a
buttered scone into his hand, and asked if she
should bring him a cup of tea. It would never
be Marget, he heard them say, if she’d thought
of setting him up for his ride like that. He
shook his head at the tea and stared helplessly
at the scone, while they pulled at his arm and
wished him luck, or clapped him on the shoulder
in farewell. Somebody begged him to give them
a tune for the last time, but he was too dazed
by the sun to heed what they said. He just
stood there, fiddle and scone in hand, staring
about him like a puzzled child. Then the parson
came along and wished him a pleasant ride, and
shook the hand that wasn’t holding the scone.
Everybody seemed glad for him that he was
going home, that he was getting away from
Marget, after all. Folks were nearly always
glad when they saw others going home. They
felt kindlier towards them then than at any
other time, he thought. Folks away from home
were a kind of public trust. The world was
worried about them until they were safely back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span></p>

<p>Bob begged the parson to help the old man
into the trap, and at once there were a dozen
hands hoisting him up the step, holding needlessly
to the horse’s head, and pulling the children
from under the wheels. Kit arrived at his seat
a little breathless and pulled about, and felt the
fiddle quiver against his coat. He was grateful
for the sympathy and help, but he had not
expected to be sped by a crowd. He couldn’t
help shrinking from the cheerful voices and the
smiling eyes that made of him a spectacle in the
street. They confused him and crossed his
thoughts—troubled his perfect journey at the
start. He did not know what to do with the
buttered scone, and the button-hole worried
him dreadfully under the chin. He would have
liked to creep quietly out of the house where he
had been so sad, and steal silently towards the
house where he had been so gay.</p>

<p>The crowd saw that they fretted him at last
and drew away, but Bob still talked to the parson
over the wheel. The old man looked back up
the street, and saw the village radiant in the
sun, the white wall of the school like a snow-palace
in its midst, and the church-tower high
and sharp against the sky. He looked up at
the trees and saw the leafy roof thick and green
and still, and the doors of many mansions
among the boughs. “Houses not made wi’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
hands,” he said to himself, and wondered where
he had heard the words. He looked at the
cottages, with their porches and worn steps,
their shaded windows and grey walls, their
climbing roses and sagging, slated roofs. And
for a long moment he looked at his own window
which held the enchantment of the tree. From
his window on the marsh he would see no trees,
neither magic ones on a velvet sward nor giants
bent into bondage by the gale. There would be
nothing before his eyes which had been straitened
so long but the long distances of the sands
and the long pathways of the sea.</p>

<p>Bob sat up and put his hand on the whip, and
saw the onlookers black as ink against the swimming
gold of the road. Kit’s hat was over his
eyes, so that he did not see Marget at the wheel
until she spoke. Then he looked and saw her
white face and her fringe, and the red head of
the baby glowing in the light. “Think on you
can come back,” she said in her hard tones, and
repeated it as they slowly drew away. He
nodded vaguely by way of reply, wondering
why she talked of coming back when he was not
yet conscious of being gone, and Bob said
hurriedly, “Ay, ay, he knows,” and flourished
the ragged whip. The horse gathered itself
into a slow trot, and Marget fell back out of
sight. The river that was yet road began to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
swim past, lined with waving figures on its
banks. They lurched away straight into the
eye of the sun, and the folk came back to the
street to watch them go. Kit looked a very
old man indeed from behind, and Bob’s shoulders
seemed tired and slack. They were like weary
folk hurrying into the light to be made young
and strong. The swing of the cart behind the
rolling horse gave them the air of going very
fast. Those who were left talking in the street
began to dispute whether the old man would
look round. “Nay, he’s over glad to be off,”
said one; “he’ll look round none, will the old
chap, not he!” And another said, “He’s not
found it that grand he’ll risk his neck for it, I’ll
swear!” But a woman said, “We’ve had
many a crack together, him and me”; and
another said, “He makes his own things to suit
himself with, does Kit.”</p>

<p>They watched the trap to the end of the street,
past the little white rows that had steps up to
the doors, and the woodyard and the smithy
and the farmhouse by the bridge, and still Kit
did not turn. The trap gave a sudden swerve,
and they could see the buttered scone held
tightly in his hand. Bob leaned towards him
and spoke, but the old man gave no sign of
reply.</p>

<p>And then just at the very last he turned,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
when another minute would have blotted him
out. All he could see now was the tunnel of
the trees, with the houses showing dimly along
the side. He had thought himself free without
so much as a pang, but somewhere a link was
holding, after all. Something was left behind
in the village street, something that would not
follow, that could not come. He felt the tug at
his heart and looked back, though it was too
late to do anything but look. It passed as soon
as the turn was passed, and his heart lifted,
thinking itself loosed. Nevertheless, something
was gone that he might not find again—something
that he had made in prison, and might
not take away.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">Once they were past the turn, Bob let the
horse slip into a walk, and moved in his seat
with something like relief. Now they were out
of reach of the following eyes, and especially of
Marget’s terrible eyes. Even they, piercing as
they were, could not bore through stone and
rising earth. The remains of his youth awoke
at this touch of adventure and escape, and he
looked about him from side to side, and whistled
as if compelled by the rhythm of the hoofs.
The old man stirred, too, and looked about,
and suddenly, with a half-mechanical lifting of
the hand, he began to eat his buttered scone.
He forgot it again, however, after a couple of
bites, because his memories crowded in too
fast.</p>

<p>They came to the twilight spot on the river
bank where he had played until Marget found
him out, but he barely looked at it as he drove
past. He was a different person to-day from
the shabby fiddler who had played through
stolen hours to an idle ring. A charm had
begun to work after he reached the turn, so
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>that he was no longer the down-trodden creature
rated by a shrew. Now he was just the simple
old man who had lived at the sea’s edge with a
fiddle under his arm. Marget’s voice was no
longer in his ears, but the voice of the peewit
and gull and the rush of the incoming tide.
And Bob, too, was changed from a dull epitome
of mistakes to a soul who remembered the pride
and spring of life. If Kit had turned to look
at him just then, he would have seen him a
moment in his splendid youth, with the wrestler’s
steady eye and muscular grace. He remembered
him conqueror in many a ring, and wondered
what had become of his cups and belts.
They were not at the cottage, he felt sure of that.
Marget would have been sure to say they were
“in the road,” and at least he would have seen
the children using them in their play. Bob’s
exploits were never mentioned in that house,
because Marget was of opinion that wrestling
was low. Probably the trophies had gone long
since to provide other things more necessary if
less proud. But in the old days there had been
a grand show of them on the dresser at the farm,
polished glories that, when the dusk came,
made silver points of light both above and within
the oak.</p>

<p>The river still ran by them on the left, and
beyond it was the climbing sweep of the park,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
with the belts of wood binding it east and west.
Once, coming home in the dawn from a dance
on the far side, he had found a little fawn in a
dim glade. It was said to be lucky to find a
new-born fawn. Over the hill-top the wishing-trees
used to stand, but he had never been back
there since they were cut down. Things couldn’t
alter as long as you didn’t go back. They
stayed the same while you kept them so in your
mind.... The further wood was slowly growing
black, because of the hill between it and the
west. At the foot of the wood was the long,
clean-coloured house, with its pillars and flat
windows and wide, stately steps. Kit saw his
own life clearly when he looked at the house,
because the lives within and around the house
were bound together like a bundle of sticks.
Through all his memories the romance of a
higher class ran like a silken thread through a
homespun cloth. High and low, they had seen
together so much that was the same. They had
watched death and life changing the country-side,
and awakened each morning to the gift
of the same day. They had done many things
together, too, and where one had done them
alone, the one that looked on seemed still to
have his share. Glancing back from a great
age, it was hard to tell where the lives really
drew apart. Rich or poor, they belonged to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
same scheme of things, and had their final share
in the same earth.</p>

<p>He could not have told you how many
squires he had known. The old family had died
off fast, and in the multitude of their names he
could not be certain which had gone churchwards
first. He was always put to it when asked to
say whether Philip Edmund or Edmund John
had died before the succession honours were
barely his; whether John Philip or merely
John had lived to the striking age of fifty-one.
One who had lived to be really old had died
when Kit was a lad; a fine, old-fashioned
autocrat who knew his place. Folks saluted on
all sides when he walked up the street, and the
women had had to go in and shut their doors.
Perhaps he was at his best in the church over the
hill, with its hacked Crusader monument and its
floor paved with names. All who served him had
to come to church, wearing the livery of their
class. Even the keepers from over the sands
had to be there, crossing the river-channel when
they could. The head keeper wore a scarlet
coat, he thought, and the others green, and the
men with the hound-dogs, blue. Coachmen and
grooms came in livery, too, with buttons that
shone like little moving moons. Through the
deep, diamond-paned windows you could see the
churchyard full of gold laburnum trees, and old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
houses with their feet among the tombs, and
luminous patches of morning sky. Those who
had been rich or poor in their lives shared the
gold of the laburnum equally in death. Nobody
nodded in the sermon under the Squire’s eye, or
moved a foot to the aisle until he had left the
church.</p>

<p>Now they were passing the agent’s house on
the right, a creepered dwelling facing river and
hill. It was many a long year since he had been
inside, but a certain room was always clear in
his mind. He had gone to ask for the farm when
his father died, and taken with him the lass he
meant to wed. They had sat stiffly on the
leather chairs, speaking their parts as bravely as
they could. Ann had been far the smarter of the
two, spoken up better and known what she was
about. Likely enough they had got the farm
because of her, but he wasn’t the only man who
had to own to that. She was always the better
horse, as everybody knew....</p>

<p>Now, when he thought of the room, it was like
a picture in a book, and the shy young couple
seemed like pictures, too. Yet all his life he had
thought of Ann as she was then, with her dark
stuff gown and the colour bright in her cheeks,
and his real self was still that daft young man,
twisting his cap on the edge of an office chair.
Folks said you lived your life before you were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
twenty-five, and that all the rest was simply
looking back. Marget would have it he had
changed, but change couldn’t touch that picture
in his mind. Ann and Kit still sat on their
leather chairs, smiling at him, steadfastly alive.</p>

<p>The plantation further on which he had seen
cut down, was grown again just as tall and thick.
The road was dark and damp under the trees,
cool in summer and muddy in the wet. Down
this hill he had once seen timber-waggons
running away. It must have been winter
because it had snowed in the night, and the sky
was black and the road just sprinkled white.
The river was the colour of the blade of an axe,
and running as if it was out of control, too. The
children were coming from school when the first
waggon got away, with a team of three horses
and a load of larch. The long, clean poles,
straight as a ship’s masts, swung like an
anchored boat to the incoming tide. The driver
was running close in front of the wheel, lying
back on the reins and shouting all the way. The
children scattered like feathers thrashed from a
bed, and collected again to watch the waggon
take the turn, skidding and swinging broadways
to the road. The other waggon braked along
the wall, driving a furrow in mortar and moss
and fern. Kit remembered it all as if it had
been last week,—the fine bite in the air and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
thundering hoofs, the musical clink of the
brasses and the fierce clanking of the chains, the
swing and heave and weight and length of the
load, the great horses, the nerve and strength of
the men.... When you were old you liked to
think of these things, to remember that not
everybody grew old at the same time. Once he
had seen Bob lift a trap through a gate with the
help of the cowman from the Hall. The broad
shoulders and strong wrists had raised the
wheels like toys, and the Squire had sat in the
trap above their heads and laughed. And there
were still men to do these things though Bob
had fallen out. Youth was still in the world,
and hands were firm on a rein....</p>

<p>Bob pulled up on the bridge before he turned
to the marsh, to let him look at the river from
either side. And first he looked at it sliding
through the park, between grass banks and
bulrushes and dreaming, stooping trees. Through
the trees he saw flashes of red and white that
were cattle coming down to drink, and where
the sun had left the water black there was the
sudden whiteness of still swans. The ghosts of
themselves gleamed at them from beneath, and
when the cattle stooped to drink there would be
coloured cattle in the water, too. The fish were
rising as the shadows grew, stirring the river
with their delicate rings. It was hard to remember<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
in the peace that all water had its toll,
even this calm dreamer shedding its gold coat.
Yet it, too, had its weeds that could drag a
swimmer down, its black spot of tradition where
the brothers had been drowned, pools where the
lonely had sought a greater solitude still. But
to-night the peace of the evening was glad peace,
because of the Tyranny of Marget overpast.</p>

<p>On one side of the bridge the river was making
ready for the night, but on the other it was still
sunny and awake. It had still to get out on to
the sands, to catch the last drop of gold as it fell
from the lingering day. There were no bridges
or banks to gather it into shade, or trees that
hushed the water with shadow long before the
sun was under the sea. Once safely out it ran
in a glinting length in which nothing was
mirrored but the sky. This was the river he
knew best, that was never afraid of the lonely
flat or the Terrible Friend that was the tide.
In the park and the village it was cluttered and
darkened by the growing things on its banks,
like the minds of folks who lived in a close
street. Here, on the edge of the world, nobody’s
shadow could tread on your heels. He drew a
breath of relief as they turned for the moss-road,
and took another bite from his buttered scone.</p>

<p>The moss-road, running close beside the sands,
with the sea-wall on its left like a ruled fence,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
had grassy borders dropping to grass-grown
dykes. Beyond the hedge to the right the fields
lay level and square, planned for the easy
handling of the plough. The long lines of the
roots were at right angles to the long line of the
road, and when there was wind over the young
corn it billowed across it in unbroken waves.
Marsh and sands were full of these darting lines
with their sense of flight, as if they were arrows
shot from the bow of the eye.</p>

<p>Dropping behind them to the south was the
hamlet above the beach that had once been
known as a port. All its white faces were snowy
in the sun, but there were no sails slipping to rest
in front of it to-day. Yet it was not so long
since ships had sailed from there to trade with
Spain. Kit remembered the old merchant who
had owned the ships, with his comb of white
hair, round spectacles and benevolent grey eyes.
The Spanish trade had died with him, and
seemed like a fairy tale to-day. He had been
everybody’s friend who needed a friend, and
there had been hands in his pockets all his life.</p>

<p>The sky in front of them seemed packed to the
sun with hills, the crowded purple mountains
threaded with the dales. They looked empty as
hills of the moon from across the bay, but Kit
had many friends along their flanks. The folk
there knew to the full what winter meant, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
rain falling like rods from the high tops, and
nights that were endless, whether wild or still,
and becks at the flood and the great drama of
the snow. From the marsh the hills were soft as
blue clouds poised light on each other’s backs,
but Kit knew that their bodies were strong soil
and their bones of iron. He knew the rough
grass that clothed them as Nebuchadnezzar was
clothed with hair. He knew the exalted joy of
mounting on their backs, like riding some
mighty horse across the earth. He knew their
crag-faces and screes, their smooth, green slides
and rocky ghylls. He knew their moorland and
moss-hags, their bog-pools and lost tarns. He
knew the lone, white-fronted farms, and the
becks rushing at their doors. And in the midst
of the loneliness he had only to climb some peak,
and find himself at home because looking out
to sea.</p>

<p>He had often gone up to play in the dales, and
of all his dances he had liked these best. First
of all came the journey, which was always an
adventure in itself. Some sudden turn from the
high road to the north, and he was plunged in a
twisting lane between the hills. Already, perhaps,
it would be dusk, because of the barrier to
the west, which grew and darkened and grew as
the shadows gathered and trailed. He himself
was small as a gnat on the thread of road,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
between the monsters soaring on either side.
There would be water talking out of the shadows
here and there, hidden streams and falls with the
last light flashing on their manes. Always he
heard the water-talk when he went into the
dales, because it was so different from the voice
of his own sea. And, greater than the water, was
the stillness, that nothing was ever big enough
to break, neither the shrill dogs nor the shepherds’
whistle nor the cry of the sheep. Even
thunder and wind could only trouble it for a
time, like the floating of furious smoke across
a glass. Behind them you felt the imperturbable
patience of a greater strength. It was a
different stillness from the empty silences of
the marsh. It was the live stillness of great
bodies, crowded side by side, whom even Nature
seemed powerless to stir.</p>

<p>His journey’s end was always some farmhouse,
where he had a meal before starting for
the dance. From these dwellings, which he often
saw only by night, he carried pictures of
shadowy rafters and firelit walls, blind staircases
to which he trusted himself as to a horse
knowing its way, and clean, bare rooms upstairs
where a lighted candle seemed to bring the
mountains into the house itself. After the meal
he groped his way at a lantern’s tail to the
festive barn. He could trace the hedges by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
shadowy line along their tops, and smell the
smell of earth that is damp in the night, and
hear the sheep-wail out of the void. And then,
in the midst of the dark, that was either smooth
blackness or full of looming shapes, the door of
the barn would open a yellow port-hole to the
night. He left the night with regret, although
he grew in stature as he went in, and the fiddle,
too, increased in weight and power. Out in the
dale it had seemed a tinkling thing, but once
inside its voice was proud and strong. On the
rough platform or the corner chair where they
spent the night, he and his fiddle came proudly
into their own.</p>

<p>Sometimes he got to the barn first and had time
to look about the great, bare place that to-night
was the heart of the dale. The knotted floor
was well swept, and slippery with shredded wax.
Forms were set along the walls, with clean
paper at their backs, and high above that were
the glistening, steady lamps. There were food
and drink on tables at the end, white cloths and
bright tea-urns and polished cups and plates.
Far over all was the darkness of the roof, untouched
by the light as the dale through the
big doors. Outside the door, the opening had
shone gold; on this, it was only a gaping
square of black.</p>

<p>But the lads and lasses were waiting, as a rule,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
clear-skinned, dark-haired folk with still, grey
eyes, and feet that were tapping the floor before
he had tuned. He thought about them as he
played with a steady swing, of their lives and the
lives that had made them what they were. He
thought of their old names, and the way they
bred so true to type and strain. He thought of
the long silences in which they spent their days,
of their courtesies and roughnesses, their simple-mindedness
and reserve, their inherited knowledge
of the lonely places of the earth. He
thought of their houses, with rafters and wide
hearths, their worn flags and sudden steps, their
deep sills and oak stairs. He thought of the
windows which, at break of day, held pictures
never seen on any wall. He thought of the hills
where they walked, that were rich with Viking
names and cradled the Viking dead. He
thought of the secrets of the hills, of their
mysterious dangers and almost-forgotten rites.
It was a hundred years, perhaps, since they
lighted the last fire on Baal’s Hill; less than
seventy since the wildfire had gone round. The
fire-charmers were barely dead, or the tooth-charmers,
or the old women who knew the
herbs. Folk lived long in the dales, and the old
secrets longer still. Gods were not of necessity fled
because the sacrifice was past. There was still
that feeling up in the wastes that out of nothing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
something might appear. There were lakes in
which drowned bodies never rose, and terrible
winds which could slay you in a breath. Folks
said there were spirits who hated the railways
crossing the moors, and were glad when the big
trains came to harm in the night. Things were
as strange as when there were devils on Cross
Fell, and the idol lay in its bed at Kirkby Thore.
The dale-folk were wonderful to Kit, because of
the mysteries in their blood, but often he found
them rather pitiful, too. Often they seemed to
him, as he played, like children dancing in a
lighted cave. He thought of the cave as set in a
blackened void, with giants of darkness stooping
over its roof. The folk in the cave were not
afraid, because for them the cave was the whole
world. So heedless they seemed, and young, so
fleet-passing and yet so strong. Death slew
them, and yet they came in the same form, with
the same faces and voices and transmitted ways.
Life must surely be stronger than death, while
the stamp of it stood so long....</p>

<p>When he forgot the cave he thought of their
home-going in the dawn, of lights in misty
shippons and the ivory gleam of milk. The
mountains were fresh-made again, gentle as all
new-born things. He saw the folks sitting at
their meals, and heard them call to each other in
the yards. He saw them dipping and clipping<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
year by year, or high and alone with their dogs
among the drifts. He thought of them kneeling
in the little church, with Philip, Lord Wharton’s
Prayer-Books in their hands. He thought of
bridals under the axe-hewn beams, of corpse-roads
over the fells, and arvel-bread....</p>

<p>Suddenly Bob spoke, making him start, for
there had been years as well as miles between
them as they drove. “You’ll be right suited to
be back,” he said, flicking the dull horse with a
listless whip. “It was a sad pity you ever had
to quit.”</p>

<p>Kit said “Ay, ay,” rather vaguely, for he
wanted to be left alone with his thoughts. Bob
had already lost the exhilaration of setting out,
and there was no place for this drooping failure
in Kit’s mind. Besides, here on the marsh the past
was so alive that voices barely found their way to
his ear. No human speech, indeed, could have
the colour and flow and flight of this epic spoken
by his own soul. There was wistfulness in his
memories but they were not sad, because only
evil memories are sad. Beauty grows like a
rose over every other, even pain; perhaps
especially over pain. While he walked in his
memories he was young and brave, unclogged
by poverty, uncrippled by age. And how, in
any case, could he be sad, who was going at
long last to his home?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span></p>

<p>“They wanted you right off,” Bob went on.
“They never give me no peace till I’d fixed
a day.”</p>

<p>“They’re right kind,” Kit murmured, not
thinking of them at all. He took another bite
of the scone and tried to see the land around,
instead of lighted caves and valleys in the dawn.
“I think a deal o’ the spot,” he added, after a
while. “I doubt I’d got too old to change.”</p>

<p>“Ay, but there’s changes at the farm an’ all,”
Bob said, with a note of warning in his voice.
“’Tisn’t in nature for things to stop the same.
There’s bound to be changes when different
folks get hold.”</p>

<p>Kit said “Ay, ay,” again, and munched
stolidly at the scone. Marget had said things
like that, and now she was saying them again
through Bob. But he had left Marget ever so far
behind, and out on the marsh she could not
make him afraid. There couldn’t be changes in
the place where he was at peace, because permanence
was the essence of all peace. Bob
should have known that, but Bob had forgotten
peace. Bob, as his shoulders dropped, had
found Marget still at his back. Not even on
the marsh could Bob escape.</p>

<p>“’Tisn’t in nature,” Bob was saying again.
“Folks is that different, they’re bound to make
things different, too.” All his sentences seemed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
like tame echoes of Marget’s biting speech. “I
don’t know as it ever does for folks to gang
back.”</p>

<p>“Ay, well, I can nobbut try,” Kit said, sitting
up and speaking with sudden force. “As for
the changes you’re making out, I reckon they
waint bite. There’s nowt can change that much
in a couple o’ years, not things as is fairly set.
There’s no change on the marsh as I can see, for
all the sea’s frettin’ at it still; and danged if
Jim Bell grandmother bedstead baint mendin’
yon fence yet!”</p>

<p>“Marsh don’t change overmuch, but it
changes, all the same. What, they say, don’t
they, as it all come out o’ the sea? Yon’s
change enough, surely, when you come to think
on? And folks change a deal faster than land
and suchlike. I reckon you’ve changed yourself,
these last two years.”</p>

<p>They were only Marget’s words, like the rest,
but just for the moment they struck a little
chill. It was likely enough that he had altered,
as they said, when you came to think what those
two years had meant. He had thought himself
at the end of change when he left the farm,
except for the change that is the beginning of
things. If there were any currents left in his
life’s stream, they had seemed too weak to carry
him off his feet; yet now they were stirring and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
lifting him again. But if it was true that there
were changes in himself, they could only be
superficial, after all. Marget’s branding-iron
could not permanently have disfigured his soul.
At least he was sure that folks going home
turned again into their old selves. When they
went in at the door they forgot at once everything
that had pushed its way in between. The
real things were there, as they found; the real
selves, the real souls. The rest was incidental
as garments flung away. The old feeling took
them that they were looking forward instead of
back, happy because of the future instead of the
past. Yet really they were happier than they
had been before, because of the extra gladness
of coming home. They would hardly know
themselves when they looked in the glass,
because the faces and feelings did not match.
The place was full of things that took them
back—like the smell and feel of things, and the
sun on the floor. No matter what life had
managed to do to them, it faded now. These
were the real things where their real selves had
stayed. They were the same, in spite of the
years, abidingly, patiently, blessedly the same.</p>

<p>He was so certain about it all that he spoke
even more forcibly than he had done before.
“I’d not change to the marsh if I was dead and
riz!” he said. “I’d not change to the farm if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
Squire offered me the Hall. And I’d be Kit Sill
and for evermore Kit Sill, if I was coming from
Heaven an’ nobbut from next door!”</p>

<p>Bob said drearily that likely his father knew his
own business best. His own belief in the ultimate
rightness of things had long since gone by
the board, and he found it strange that Kit’s
should be lingering still. The artist’s faith that
yet all things shall be well had flamed for only
a period in Bob. Marget had soon set herself to
work to trample it out. Yet here was old Kit
still brandishing the torch. But then Kit had
only suffered for the space of a couple of years.</p>

<p>In spite of his admission, however, he seemed
unable to let the subject drop. It was almost as
if Marget must be whispering into his ear.
“You’ll think on Marget said you could come
back?” he wandered on. “She’s likely taken
to you a deal better than I thought. If happen
you don’t feel like settling at the farm, you’ve
nobbut to say the word and come back.”</p>

<p>“I’ll settle, thank ye,” Kit said. “I will
that.” Bob ought to have known, he thought,
that it was simply a waste of time to talk like
that. Marget was an outsider, of course, but
Bob had once belonged. “Don’t fret yourself,”
he said. “I’ll settle all right. I’ll bide.”</p>

<p>“Farm’s that smart it don’t know itself,”
Bob said, “what wi’ new paint and paper and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
furniture as good as Squire’s. What, there’s a
rug afore t’kitchen fire as’d likely make a
carpet at our spot, I’m sure! There’s curtains
to all the winders—some on ’em real lace; and
parlour’s over grand to set in by a deal. They’ve
been to a sight o’ pains fixing your old room an’
all. You’d think as the King hisself was coming
to stop on the marsh.”</p>

<p>Kit listened to him, but only with half an ear,
wondering why Bob should suddenly have so
much to say. He knew nothing about the house
of which Bob spoke, and didn’t want to know
anything, if it came to that. The house he was
going to see to-day was quite a different spot.
It was empty and shabby and rather short of
brass, but it was full of the soft tones that make
for peace. There was no colour in it that the
sun had never kissed, or wood that the years
had not mellowed in its place. The worn
surfaces knew his hand, and the uneven flooring
had never troubled his feet. What, there was a
sunk flag at the kitchen door that had never
tripped his toe in fifty years!...</p>

<p>“Thomas mun ha’ done well for himself,”
Bob was drawling at his side. “He mun ha’
laid by a deal more than we ever thought. I
reckon he could ha’ taken the farm all right yon
time as they went and turned you out. But
they said the lass wasn’t for wedding him just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
then, and he was feared he’d loss her if he come
away. She should think shame of herself, she
should, for putting us all about.”</p>

<p>“Nay, nay,” Kit put in, “she did right to
take her time. It’s an easy enough business
getting wed, but none so easy to bear wi’ when
it’s done. And she’s a good lass, they say, for all
she give him sneck-posset at the start. She’ll
do well for me, Thomas said; she’ll see to me
like her own. I reckon I waint come off so
badly, after all.”</p>

<p>Bob thought gloomily of the bearing with
things which he had brought upon himself, and
of the wife that was neither a good lass nor kind,
but at the same time some remnant of feeling
ranged him on Marget’s side. He, too, couldn’t
help feeling sore because the old man was going
away. He was not jealous as she was jealous,
because her bone was being touched, but it hurt
him that others should do for his father what he
wanted to do himself. It was his place to be at the
farm and to give his father a home, and, Marget
apart, it would have been his pleasure as well.
But both duty and pleasure were in this case out
of reach, and it was his younger brother who had
the right, as well as the place and the brass and
the luck of a kindly wife. The last humiliation
was that he should be here, driving the old man
to the home that he preferred. Thomas had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
offered to fetch his father himself, but Bob’s
pride had suddenly flickered, and he had
refused. Now, however, he cursed himself for
not letting Thomas have his way, because it
seemed that he came with his failure in his
hand—with a tacit admission that he had
nothing to give. He wondered if Kit thought
of it like that, and felt the slow blood rise and
burn his cheek.</p>

<p>He tried to comfort himself with the thought
that things would be easier at home, now that
the burden and bugbear had gone away. Of
course, they would miss the money to some
extent, but there would be one mouth less to
feed, as well as more room in the kitchen and
less friction—perhaps—at meals. Marget would
have no more tales to tell him at night of the
bother his father had given her in the day. He
would not have to lie in the dark and listen to
his crimes—how he had torn his jacket or got
lost, or sniffed at his pudding or broken a chair.
He would not hear her beating the old man with
her tongue, in default of the blows that she dealt
her weaker prey. And at least he would be free
of the dread that tragedy might be the end—some
sudden violence, perhaps, or the river under
the trees. He could sleep now without hearing
the old man’s cough; it would be somebody
else’s job to see to that. He could go to work<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
unhaunted by the old man’s boots, gaping and
sagging and leaking in the wet. Thomas would
see to the boots and Agnes to the cough, and to
other little things like socks and shirts. Kit
would be housed and fed as he had not been for
years, and he could play his fiddle again on his
old marsh. Bob knew what that special
deprivation must have meant; he was true
enough son of Kit to guess at that. Things
seemed to be looking up for them all round, and
he knew he ought to be glad if he couldn’t be
proud. At least the burden was off the failure’s
back, which had more than enough to carry, as
it was. But all that he really felt was jealous
shame, and a hope that Thomas, too, might
somehow fail.</p>

<p>He need not have been afraid, however, that
Kit was despising him in his heart. He had
forgotten him completely as he drove, as well as
the ghost of Marget at his back. If he thought
of him at all, it was as a boy, trudging to school
or running about the marsh. Sometimes,
indeed, he went back so far that Bob had not
even begun to exist. Perhaps he lingered
longest at that stage, because the mind is
coming full circle at the last. Youth must
inherit heaven as well as the earth, because most
of us are made young again at the end. Bob’s
words came out of a mist that covered the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
immediate past, like the gulls he had often
heard crying over a foggy sea. He slipped right
away from it through the years, as the swifts
dipped and dropped about the steeple under the
hill. But no matter where he was, the things
around him were always good. The steady sun
warmed him and the air was cool in his throat.
His eyes rested themselves on hedge and dyke,
and line upon long line of sand; but all the time
he saw as much with his heart as with his eyes.</p>

<p>All the days that had found him on that road
were present with him to-night;—golden days,
such as this, and the quiet, grey days that
seemed scarcely to draw a breath from dawn to
dusk. On those days the whole world was grey,
not as if hidden by a veil, but grey-washed by a
broad yet feathery brush. Wet days, many and
long, when the rain blowing in from the sea was
as level as the sun; mornings, fiercely cold, with
the north wind dropping straight from the high
snows; evenings, drenched with mist and
haunted by pale sheaves, peering over the road
at the lapping tide. Moons world without end he
had seen stand over the marsh, the first moon of
the year, light and thin as the edge of a tossed
coin, to the great harvest moon that was not
like an English moon at all. There was something
in the nature of Divine revelation about
the moon that came with the sheaves, a touch of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
the mystical meaning that shone so plain from
the Bethlehem Star. It was not only that it was
so big and bright, as if it had really eaten all the
rest. It had a tremendous personality of its own,
a calm force that could be felt. You were never
alone on the marsh while a moon walked with
you there; but when the harvest moon rose up,
it was like a majestic stranger in a room.</p>

<p>Days of storm, when he had to fight his way
at his horse’s head; and whirling snow-days,
with the ditches level with the road. Summer,
when the tall grasses almost hid the dykes, and
the tall hedges all but hid the fields. Spring,
with a wail beside that of the curlew in the air,
and lambs like new flowers all over the coloured
carpet by the sea.</p>

<p>Nights, too, that would never in any world
come back to him again ... and dawns when,
returning from some dance, he had run from
the sun that was hunting him over the hill. Out
to sea all was still dark, and the road before him
unsubstantial as a cloud. There might be sea to
each side of him for all he knew, for land that
has once belonged to the sea has always the
feeling of sea-ground in the night. The music
he had made was still in his brain, making
itself again to the horse’s hoofs and the beat of
a hidden train along the coast. The fiddle
inside his coat was thrilling and singing like his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
brain. Not for long after they reached home
would either of them be still.</p>

<p>And then, over the chain that cuts England
in two, bursting out over the top like a man who
rushes the last few feet of a climb, the sun took
the marsh and the Lake mountains in its stride.
Out of the blotted dusk soft, nebulous shapes
arose. Faint colour came into the grass, faint
silver into a stream. Life flowed into the faintly-living
earth, and grew fuller and faster as it
moved. He saw the cattle stand up, and the
sheep come away from the hedges that were full
of the questioning twitter of the birds. The
larks went up from the still-shadowy fields,
racing the sun for the earliest word with God.
There was a gleam of marsh-marigolds in the
dykes, though still unburnished and dim. In all
the waking world he and his horse alone were
sinking into sleep, and though the river was
still sombre when he reached its banks, it was
drawing in light each moment from the sky.
The farm, when he saw it at last, seemed painted
for him against the tide, with the yew a black
finger against a whitened wall. All the air
about it was still and sunshot and transparent
and pure. Suddenly he saw a hand open a
window upstairs, and knew that his wife had
heard him on the road.</p>

<p>Often enough, if the night was very wild, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
found her waiting for him at the gate of the
yard. The tide would be thundering and swirling
behind the bank, swaying and swishing as if
pent in a great, shaken pot. The waves tearing
across the bay were swifter than any boat, and
the shock of them striking the bank was like the
shock of rolled logs against the gates of the
earth. In the black dark that was full of a
million spouts the showers of spray shot up to
meet the rain. It was hard to tell where the
tide really stopped, even with that frustrated
roar at the sea-wall. Any step, so it seemed,
might find them the black flood at their very
feet. They had known it steal its way into the
garden before now; into the yard, and, once
only, into the house. In that upstairs room
where his dream always came to an end, they
had sat and listened to the water surging below.
They could hear the furniture bumping like
anchored boats, and the water slapping and
gurgling at the stair. They had scarcely said a
word to each other all the time, because of the
wind that was howling round the house. There
might have been only one building in the world,
and the wind sworn to tear it down. All they
could do was to sit and wait and wonder when
the gale would allow the tide to turn. They
were not really afraid of the raving and threshing
of the sea, scarcely more than a man is afraid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
of the bark of his own dog. They barely troubled
themselves to guess where the rising water
might end. They did not picture the room
grown black with the drowned light, and filled
like a vault until the ceiling was reached....</p>

<p>This was the Great Storm, but there were
many lesser ones, when, gripping each other
while he clung to the horse, they groped to the
stable by the lantern swung on her arm. The
gulls would be screaming in clouds above their
heads, but the dark and the wind hid their
wild swinging and their cries. Only when the
late dawn began and the bigger water drew
back, they would see them sweeping and plunging
about the house, filling the garden with
curving shadows and faint gleams of feathered
white....</p>

<p>They did not meet a soul as they jogged
along; none at least, that Bob was able to see.
At intervals, somebody hailed them from a
field, and the voice, after reaching them, travelled
out on the sand. Hard, brown hands went up
over eyes that saw the trap all black against
the gold. Everybody on the marsh knew that
Kit was coming home, and most would have
liked a look at him and a word. If all tales
were true, he must be as glad as a crowned king,
and they would have liked to tell him they
were glad as well. Besides, the folks at home<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
would be sure to ask how he was, and whether
he looked half-clemmed, as it was said. Ay,
and if he was getting daft, as Marget had put
about, and whether the same old fiddle was
fiddling still. But the trap went on, and the
questions remained unsolved. Only Bob’s dull
voice came back to them over the marsh.</p>

<p>The old man did not hear the hails, because
he was busy listening to other talk. Now he
was nodding his head at all manner of folk, and
stretching down his hand for a hearty shake.
Sometimes he checked the trap with a tug at
the rein, and kept Bob waiting while he had a
crack with this body and then with that. Bob
thought he was taking a look round, and let
the old man sit as long as he liked, but Kit was
doing a great deal more than look. He was
puzzled to find so many folk out and about on
the marsh at the same time, but he was more
than pleased to set eyes on them again. Every
single one of them wanted a crack with the old
man who was so terribly busy going home, and
his own tongue was as lish as most, for the matter
of that—so lish that it wouldn’t rest quiet in
his mouth. It had been stiff and frozen for many
a long month, but now it was getting away like
a beck in spate. He seemed to himself to be
talking very loud, and to laugh a great deal,
and to hear the other folks talking like a lot of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
crows. It was surely a rare stroke of luck that
so many should be about just when old Fiddlin’
Kit was busy coming home! He found it as
stimulating as any dance, with figures whirling
over a crowded floor. The fiddle was quivering
under his coat, as it always did at once if he
raised his voice. He would have taken it out
and played the folk a tune, but he was never
finished with all he wanted to say. Bob was
forgotten completely, but he did not mind,
because he saw and heard nobody but the
peewit and the gull.</p>

<p>Now here was Jardine, the hound-man from
the Hall, who had only one hand and made
shift for another with an iron hook. He had
shot off his own hand when he was a lad, but
he had gone on using a gun as well as before.
There were hounds waiting behind him as he
paused in the road, low hounds with bowed
legs and fine heads, drooping ears and asking,
human eyes. Long ago Jardine had got blood-poisoning
feeding the pack, but Kit had quite
forgotten that he was dead. There could be
no real death on the night of his coming home—certainly
not such a dreadful death as that.
Besides, it was easy to see the man was there
alive, gaitered and grey-whiskered and thin-faced
and light-eyed. And of course there were
the asking dogs at his heel; the dogs were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
witness enough that he was alive. Yet old
Forward was dead, and Rosebud, and King’s
Own.... They had been dead for years, and
if they hunted still it was only at nights....
There were other dogs, too, with Jardine and
the pack; a pointer, for instance, somewhere
in the crowd. Kit was quite pleased to see the
brown and white sporting dog which nobody
fancied now. Suddenly, with a thrill, he noticed
a sheep-dog of his own, with a snowy patch like
a star on its black chest. It did not seem to
know he was in the trap, and none of the dogs
paid any attention to the horse. There was a
bobtail, too, full of happy smiles, and a slim
little toy that had saved the Hall in a fire.
Jardine had a gun on his left shoulder and a
couple of rabbits hanging from his hook, and it
did not seem strange in the least that he should
have gone out shooting with that doggy train.
He slung the rabbits into the trap by way of a
welcome to old Kit, and the fiddler thanked him
and nodded as he drove away. It pleased him
that he should have something of the sort to
carry home, and though he could not see the
rabbits at his feet, he felt the weight of their
bodies on his boots.</p>

<p>He had another long talk with Martin Hinde,
who had a pedigree shorthorn herd at Withergill.
Kit had muddled his stock as he had muddled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
everything else, but he loved the romance of a
big shorthorn success. He had loved the stock,
too, when it stayed in his mind, and could stand
entranced round a cattle-ring as long as most.
It seemed to him, after a while, that he got
down into the road, and argued with Martin
about a cow just over the fence, while the cow
cropped on stolidly without ever raising her
head. They talked of Royals and Royal Lancashires
and of local winners at the great shows;
of breeders and auctioneers, and great sires
whose pedigrees they knew better than their
own. They commented on the passing of the
ancient hour-glass at sales, and began to grow
heated and loud-voiced over dual purpose and
Scotch blood. They even fought the old Booth
and Bates battle over again, roaring and waving
sticks and dragging in <em>Bracelets</em> and <em>Duchesses</em>
by the hair. Kit fancied that he could see the
shadowy majesties of the herd, looming along
the road at Martin’s back. Even as shadows
they gave an impression of weight, of solid
strength in their huge bodies and great, scornful
heads, that would have been noble but for the
sullen, brooding eyes. But all that Bob saw
was empty marsh and sand, and an old man
sitting vacantly in a trap, with the last of a
buttered scone in his still hand.</p>

<p>They overtook Mrs. Holliday as they went,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
trudging home with a basket on her arm. Kit
suggested that they should stop and pick her
up, and Bob checked and looked round, and
said stolidly that he didn’t rightly know what
his father meant. Kit, however, gave Mrs.
Holliday a wink, and pointed slyly to the empty
seat; and he was sure he felt her weight when
the trap moved on, though he was careful not
to speak or look behind....</p>

<p>He had so seldom ridden in a trap that had
an empty seat that it made him ashamed to
pass anybody in the road. He had never been
proud about taking lifts himself, and nobody
had been proud about taking them from him.
He had been one of those folk who go packed
like herring to market or fair, with somebody
sitting on the nearside splashboard and the
driver cosily wedged against the rail. Even if
he started from home with only a passenger or
two, he would be sure to collect others before
he had gone far. Sometimes one of the squires
had clambered into the trap and held the fiddle
while Christopher held the reins. Somebody
always held the fiddle when the squash was
great, and the sensitive thing was happy in
their hands, because, rough or smooth, they
held it like fine glass. But the lasses held it
like the lace of a bridal veil, because of the secret
things it had danced into their hearts. Down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
in the road again they would beckon Kit to
stoop, and beg for a certain tune at a certain
dance—“Dally an’ dree,” perhaps, come Saturday
night, or “Ask and I’ll tell you, my lad,”
at Huddleston clip. He always promised without
a smile, and he never once forgot. Always
he kept the tune for the lass, however he was
begged, until the lad he was sure she wanted
led her out.</p>

<p>Fiddles, he thought to himself, as he drove,
had been more loved than anything else in the
world. There were folks who loved precious
stones and sold their souls for them and gave
their lives, but surely that was a form of daftness
and not love. And some loved books and
held them gently in their hands—he had seen
a parson or two do that and one of the squires.
But most of the books died very soon, and if
they lived they were like folks of a great age,
telling you plainly to leave them alone with the
past. Those that came again came always in a
different dress, and even the words inside were
not always the same. And some loved ships
and horses and gave them their whole hearts,
but neither a ship nor a horse lived for so very
long. The ship went down in a storm, or grew
rotten and gave at her seams, and no loved
animal ever came to a man twice. But fiddles
went on for ever and ever, and generally somebody<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
loved them all the time. It was the right
sort of love, too, because nobody could love them
in any other way—the sort that touches a loved
thing lightly, and yet thrills to it all through.
It was true that sometimes they got to the
wrong homes, but you did not find them in
terrible houses like Marget’s, as a rule. And it
was true that most folk didn’t know how to
use them, and that most folk didn’t care, but it
could only be just a few who wanted to do
them harm. Marget’s vehement hatred had
had something abnormal at its back which had
hurt him infinitely more than any insult to
himself. He had never thought of the fiddle
before except as an object of tenderness and
pride; never once, in all his days, had he even
seen it despised by a look. Why, the lasses had
sometimes sent it a present for itself, and more
than once he had found a flower thrust lightly
under the strings. It was as much for the
fiddle’s sake as for his own that he was going
home, because there it would be safe and could
sing again on the marsh. He told everybody
he met how glad the fiddle was to be going home,
and they laughed and nodded and said they
were delighted, too. Many a time, they told
him, they had missed it when it was gone.
Many a time, too, they had heard it down the
wind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span></p>

<p>He checked the trap so often that Bob protested
at last, and said it was time they were
getting to the farm, so after that he contented
himself with a wave and a tremulous hail.
He knew his friends by their walk long before
they came up, and long before he overtook
them by the look of their backs. Men of his
particular class saw so many backs—at shows
and sales, at market and at work on the land.
It was always the backs which told anything
at all; the faces were careful not to say too
much. Very soon they took on that shut and
silent look, as of men who had ceased to ask
loud questions of life. It was their backs that
betrayed them when they were getting done,
or hinted subtly how their banking-accounts
stood.</p>

<p>He always thought of backs when he thought
of a crowd, and in thinking of people he generally
thought of crowds. His life, like the lives of
most on lonely farms, was divided between
crowds and days spent more or less alone. The
gossip that kept Marget so busy in the street
did not belong to any method of living that he
knew. The daily contact with the village and
the village thoughts blurred his image of life
and obsessed his mind. Here there was no
sharp cleft between lonely and full hours, between
spaces of silence and the bargaining of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
the mart. Even collective work, such as harvest
or hay, meant little more than just occasional
speech. It was not association as Marget knew
it, all garrulous mouths and empty, idle hands.
And the crowds that he knew were real crowds,
not two or three cronies hatless in the street.
Many a time he had thought himself back in a
crowd, sitting at Marget’s in that upstairs room.
Sometimes it was a wrestling-ring he saw, with
Bob as conqueror in every round. There he
saw again the swinging hype, the showy cross-buttock
and the neat back-heel, and shouted
with pride when Bob felled his man, and laughed
aloud alone in his upstairs room. Marget had
once burst in to ask him why he laughed, but
he had only stared at her vacantly without
reply. It was no use telling her that he was in
a crowd, and that if the crowd saw fit to laugh
he must laugh as well.... It was good to feel
the press of the people all about, and the sun
that was so pleasant on the green. The champion’s
belt that Bob always wore sent out a
flash from each of its silver plates....</p>

<p>Sometimes it was another ring that he saw in a
green field, where red and white beasts went
slowly droning round. The auctioneer’s voice,
with incredible speed, hammered and coaxed
and demanded over his head. There was a
ring of backs all around the rope, broad or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
narrow, and straight or crippled and bent.
There were rich and poor backs, feeble and
strong, shy and aggressive and hopeful and
depressed, and nearly all of them were somehow
rather sad. There was every sort of jacket
upon the backs, and every kind of collar about
the necks. The gulf of the generations yawned
between the wideawake and the Trilby hat;
shades of degree were marked by the bowler
and the cap. There were faces, of course, as
well as backs, weather-beaten and shut, with
unrevealing mouths. The voice swept over
their still indifference like a storm of rain over
empty sands. Only their eyes, weighing as they
stared, followed the animals turning in the ring....
The voice beat at them and pressed and
begged, calling a possible bidder by his name,
and picking up bids without checking in its
stride. By a chain of almost invisible signs the
prices shaped themselves and mounted and
grew. Even when competition was keenest,
the faces rarely changed, and always after a
spurt of laughter they set in the old lines. But
all the time the backs were speaking aloud,
the patient, pressing, fervently-interested backs.
The hours passed, and clouds went over the sun,
and the bored and scornful-eyed cattle turned
and turned....</p>

<p>Furniture sales, too, had always been one of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
his old joys. There was something dramatic
about household goods, torn from their setting
into the uncovered day. Bow-fronted chests
of drawers, and china and candlesticks, and old
arm-chairs ... there seemed to be folks still
sitting in those chairs. At least, it was queer
how chairs, like clothes and hats, kept the look
of the people who had used them most. Perhaps
it was never quite safe to sit in a chair that
hadn’t always been your own; he had often
thought about that when the chairs went up
at the sales. Sometimes, against the leather or
the oak, he was certain he saw a shadowy old
form, which even a burying of the highest class
had not been able to carry quite away.</p>

<p>Once he had bought a chest of drawers with
a still mahogany face and rounded knobs of
glass. They looked like eight little pools in a
shining wood, and he bought it because it made
him think of that. The drawers pulled in and
out on a grain of silk—his missis had tried
them without looking at the knobs—and things
that were put away in them came out again
sweet and clean. It was a queer collection that
found home in them at last, but he seemed to
remember everything and its place. There were
the clothes that the two of them had worn
when they were wed ... Grandfather’s silk
handkerchief and grandmother’s silk shawl.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
Funeral cards and a jubilee mug, and corals
from over the sea. An old bow with a cracked
back, and an umbrella that was a present from
some squire. Rings of hair, still glossy and
bright, too lovely in colour and texture to have
come from any but a baby’s head. Horn
spectacles in a carved box, and old knitting-pins
with carved hafts; and fiddle strings, coil
upon coil, that he had never had the courage
to burn.... There were things of his wife’s,
too, that he had put away when she was dead,
though he had never succeeded in putting away
the shoes. They gave the lie to her death
merely by being about, and saying contentedly
that she would be coming in. Old shoes, he
thought to himself, like hats and chairs, had the
secret of keeping what lovers seemed to lose.</p>

<p>He felt much the same about mirrors as he
did about old chairs. Who knew how much
they had kept of what they had seen, or how
much of it they might suddenly reveal? Layer
upon layer of pictures must be sunken in their
depths, rosy and white faces, mad eyes and
cloudy hair. The depth of a mirror was the
height of the firmament itself; you had only
to turn it up to the sky to notice that. There
was room in it to make hiding-place for countless
tragedies of lives. Each time a blind was drawn
it took something from the day, and at night<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
who knew what it saw beyond the immediate
circle of the lamp? Nobody could look into it
without adding something new. A figure,
crossing the room, passed through its magic
water and emerged, yet surely left a ghost of
itself behind. Those that looked long enough
saw strange old things, it was said, but who
could tell that any saw the truth? Minds and
mirrors together could make magic enough to
frighten half a world. And there were times
when most folk, if it came to that, found even
their own faces rather strange. Behind the
presentment that they called themselves, eyes
that were dead looked at them through their
own, and smiles that belonged to others came to
their lips.</p>

<p>There was a different set of backs at the
furniture sales, less patient and more excitable,
though not less keen. Mostly they wore bead
mantles and cloth jackets and fur ruffs, and
were topped by side-away bonnets and hats
that wouldn’t let you by. They twitched and
argued a good deal, and let their faces say more
than the faces of other crowds. But they were
speaking backs, all the same, under mantle or
jacket or plaid blouse. They, too, told the tale
of youth or age, and the hope that hangs on gold
in a stocking foot.</p>

<p>Then, at the dances, there had been other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
backs again. The faces went by him under the
lamps, but each was turned away from him
towards another face. They swam in his gaze
like faces drifting in a stream, and became one
face of earnest, glowing youth. It was only
the backs he remembered when all was done,
the necks and the shining hair of the lasses,
and the broad, strong shoulders of the lads.</p>

<p>Weddings and clippings, of course, meant
crowds as well; hot-pot suppers and Primrose
gatherings ... whist-drives ... annual fairs.
Election crowds, when folk gathered in the
streets, and broke one another’s heads or other
people’s glass. Church, where folks knelt in
long, straight shafts of sun, or looked through
the cool windows and thought of the waiting
hay. Then there were buryings, buryings without
end, at which he had walked in crowds with
uncovered head or lent a shoulder to the coffins
of innumerable squires. Some day, sooner or
later, everybody walked in that particular crowd....
And once he had even seen a London
crowd, but that was very long ago. A lawsuit
over some foreshore rights was making a stir,
and Kit had been called as a witness in the case.
The crowd up there was past all knowledge and
sense, and nobody knew each other or jerked a
head. A policeman found him at a pavement
edge, waiting, he said, for people to “get by.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span></p>

<p>The last crowd of all had been Marget’s
cottage crowd, where there had been no room
for him and little breath, but now he was coming
back from it as he had come from all the rest,
from press and clamour and hurry into unpeopled
peace. He had escaped on to the edge
of the sand, where always the hunted stag
turns to safety and the sea. Now he could
look along the flat which rested the eye, and
breathe the far-travelled air which only the west
wind had breathed before. There were evening
and sun and shadows, and fields, and deep-rooted
mountains, and slow beasts. There was
a breeze stirring the shore-grasses that in all
their lives never know what it is to be really
still, and on the top of the bank others quivered
and bent, and straightened and bent and quivered
again. Bending, they looked like delicate
strokes of a slanting pen, slashed on the golden
page of the open west. The railway arches over
the sand looked like great black doors shut
between him and the coloured park that lay
behind. Only the one through which they had
come stood open wide, showing the ribbon of
road laid flatly through. Beyond, where it fled
away from the open marsh, it coiled into shadow
by wall and stooping tree. When night came,
that door, too, would close, so that Marget,
however she tried, could never pass. He would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
remember that when he went upstairs to bed,
and sleep steadily unafraid in the house at the
sand’s edge. If the moon chose to look in, he
would not care for the moon. It would have
none of the terror of Marget’s peering eye, that
had sometimes awakened him as he lay and
dreamed.</p>

<p>Yes, he was coming back as he had come
before, and not even in dreams would he come
like this again. Into this last, long, beautiful
journey he had gathered his life, and men—old
men—were not allowed to do that twice.
Now in the house on the edge of the sands he
would stay quietly until he died. Thomas and
Agnes would want to take him out—to market
and church and Milthrop Cattle Fair, but however
they urged he did not mean to go. He had
the fairs and the rest of them in his mind,
and did not need to go looking for them afield.
Besides, if he went, he would only find them
strange, a confusion of strange faces and still
stranger backs. Thomas and Agnes would fret
and think he was getting moped, but after a
bit they would let him have his way. He would
watch them trundle away and wave his stick,
and they would stop and call to know if he had
changed his mind. But he would never change
his mind or leave his recovered inheritance for
an hour. Somewhere there was a point where<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
the mind never changed again, but stayed as still
as the earth in a new-dropped wind. And the
point where he would stay in that poised
stillness would surely be the home of all his
dreams.</p>

<p>They would go, and he would see to the house,
and when there were barns to see to, he would
see to the barns as well. He had always been a
rare hand at keeping them happy and good,
and if he had failed with Marget’s brood, that
had been only an accident by the way. Marget’s
children, after the first, had seldom been
children to his mind. They had been enemies,
torturers, mockers, and trained spies. Only
once, in the Little Game, had they ever been
part of the company he loved, and very soon
afterwards he had cast them out. But no
child born on the marsh would ever be such as
they; the house would prevent it—the peaceful,
noble house. They would be friends all right,
he and those real children bred to the sound of
the sea. Thomas and Agnes could trust them
to him all right. All day he and the fiddle would
hear their feet, pattering after them on the garden
path, and climbing laboriously up the uncarpeted
stair. All day the little shrill voices
would follow the curlews out to sea, and at
night the house would be filled with the hush of
a house where children sleep. And on that last<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>
early morning, when he came to die, he would
hear a little child waking close at hand....</p>

<p>No, he would never be lonely again in all his
life, or dull and moped because he was left
behind. There were so many things waiting
for him to find them again that he would need
another life to seek them all. Every inch of the
land and stone of the house would have something
to say to him when he got back. How
many places he had loved would pull at his
heart until he had looked on them with his
bodily eyes? There were hedges, twists of the
road, lights over hill and bay—things that in
all his life had not failed in enchantment yet.
No other magic ever held but that; no other
spell grew stronger with the years. Nature kept
hold of her worshippers until they died. With
a branch of cherry or a robin’s song, the smell of
hay or the fall of June shadows pretending to
be night, she could bring them back their youth
to the very last. This, out of all the treasures
in the world, was the only one that was golden
to the end.</p>

<p>Perhaps he would never do half of what he
wished, in the little breath of time that he had
left. Perhaps he would find his legs too weak
to carry him very far. They had grown cramped
and shaky in Marget’s prison-house. Perhaps
his eyes, when wanted, would drop their lids<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
and sleep. They had slept so little at Marget’s
that they were tired.</p>

<p>Yet somehow he must gather his treasure
again, if only between the limits of a year. He
must wait for the hoar-frost over the fields and
the yellow of winter sun through a black-limbed
beech. There were growing things, too, that he
must see again—daffodils, foals, and the plums
on the south wall. The purple of Michaelmas
daisies in a mist, light on a yacht’s sails and the
mysterious glimmer of hard ice. Sea-mist that
was the ghost of the sea, with the blue-topped
mountains rocks in a snowy surf; primrose
evening over the sands and the islands of
desire. The smell of things, too—warm hay,
wet earth, and salt, lilac, syringa, the chill smell
of coming snow. The feel of things—turf and
sand ... and, rough to the elbows, the stone
of the garden wall. The sound of things—bees
in the wallflower; plover and gull; the lone
owl wheeling round the barn; the roar of the
river in flood and the swish of a little tide; the
trains in the night where they hung above the
sea. And always there were the sounds about
the house—the separate voices of door and
window and stair, of furniture that never speaks
until it is night, of winds in the house that go
not in or out, but sleep in dark corners until
they stir again....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span></p>

<p>Perhaps the losing of well-known sounds was
the loneliest loss of all, and none so lonely and
blank as the loss of a well-known step. Then
there were other sounds, as familiar as a
voice, that yet in years and years were never
traced....</p>

<p>There were doors he wanted to open again,
suddenly and alone, and, standing on the threshold,
feel all that the empty room contained.
That sudden opening of a door was one of the
beautiful happenings of life. Even outside you
heard the memories speak, creeping through
chinks and slipping along the floor. Outside,
they seemed to catch you by the throat; but,
once the knob was turned, they kissed your
cheek. Folks such as he could go blindfold to
their homes, and know where they were as soon
as they stepped inside. They knew by the feel
and smell and sound of things, and by a warm,
familiar presence in the air. That was really
why he was going home—to open the doors
again, and stand, and feel. Afterwards he would
go round and handle things ... absorbing
them tranquilly, drawing the place in. Satisfied—that
was the word he wanted for it all; satisfied,
fulfilled ... at rest ... <em>come back</em>....</p>

<p>It was surely this great content that helped
men to die when it came to the last. After all,
it only meant going a little closer to one’s earth.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
No one need mind if he wasn’t carried away
and laid in some foreign spot he had never seen.
It wouldn’t seem right to see strange names
round you when you awoke, and strange folk
rising up at the sound of the Trump. Why,
there were some he knew who would be so put
about, they would likely never stir their coffin-lids!
They’d stick in their graves and say they
hadn’t heard, before they’d go cheek-by-jowl
with off-comers to the Throne.</p>

<p>Would there be folk in Heaven as set on a spot
as so many of them were on earth? There
were plenty who wouldn’t know how to put on
time without their own little village and its
feuds. As for those who had really loved a
place, they couldn’t do anything but break
their hearts. There were folks you could never
mix—not even in Heaven; folks from places
that fought like biting steggs. You couldn’t
just set them alongside in their crowns, and take
it for granted things would come out right....</p>

<p>They wouldn’t get far with their singing, anyhow,
he thought, because you couldn’t make real
music with people who didn’t suit. He had
joined a choral society when he was young, but
left it because he could only sing with those he
liked. If somebody sat beside him who wasn’t
a friend, he hated to hear their voices mingle
and touch. The other man’s voice was an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>
enemy slaying his own, and instead of song
there was murder in his heart. Song was a
personal revelation that only a friend should
hear, and if you sang with an enemy you gave
yourself away. He had had the same trouble
at the dances, too, with a concertina played by
Darby Gill. The concertina itself was a real
joy, because of its big chords and its depth and
swing. It gave an actual physical push to the
crowd, so that you could see the couples swaying
as it swayed, but he never played his best
when it was there, because he and the fiddle
hated Darby Gill. He hoped he wouldn’t have
Darby next to him in Heaven. Anyhow, if he
had, he would never touch a string....</p>

<p>“Tide’ll be turning soon,” Bob said, and
though Kit had forgotten him long since, he
did not start, because the sea is always at the
back of the marsh-dweller’s mind. Even the
village-folk had known the tides by wind and
sky, though some of them never went down to
the bay in years. Kit and his son, of course,
knew them as they knew their meals. They
could have told you, every day, what time the
returning water drew itself from the deep....</p>

<p>It came to him suddenly that for two years
he had never seen the sea, not even heard it
except through the sound-carriers of the wind.
The thought of it set his heart leaping, and to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
his shame and astonishment he found that he was
afraid. He seemed to himself to be quite
defenceless on the open road, with only the
bank to stop what was coming out of the west.
His terror degraded him in his own eyes, and he
was as afraid of the fear as of the object of the
fear. Perhaps it was because he was old that
he was afraid, or because he had missed the
daily miracle for so long. At all events, he
trembled and gazed, and felt his hands turn
cold, and longed to be at the farm. It was
amazing that folk who knew what the sea could
do should drive so slowly in the line of the
dormant tide. If there had been any sign of
the tide he would have clutched at the reins,
and frightened Bob to death by shouting at
the horse. He looked at the land and wondered
why panic wasn’t abroad, and why the stock,
with its sure sense of coming ill, didn’t stare
and cower. Once that far, smooth water had
lifted and turned, there seemed no reason why
it should ever stop. He knew only too well,
of course, that it did not always stop. He
himself had seen it under an angry moon, lift
and lift into a huge and white-topped wall, and
sweep the marsh into a tumbling sea....</p>

<p>“We’d best be getting on,” he said in a sharp
tone, and Bob heard the fear in his voice, and
glanced at him in surprise. The old man must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>
be getting tired, he thought; he had seemed so
quiet and contented at the start. He did his
best to encourage the slow horse, but they only
jolted a little more, and seemed no nearer to
the farm. Presently he spoke again, as if he
had come to some slow conclusion of his own.
“Tide’s low, just now,” he said, as if to himself,
and at once felt his father relax and settle back.
“You’ll hear next to nowt on it to-night. I
reckon it’ll gang nigh as soon as it comes....”</p>

<p>The old man gave him no answer to his careful
speech; only he sighed suddenly and then sat
still. He told himself that he might have known
as well as Bob, if he hadn’t frightened himself
out of his daft wits. He looked at the west
and knew that no tide could come out of it to
his hurt—out of that fragrant stillness and that
golden air. And yet, in spite of his fear, he
wanted to see a tide before he died—one of
those splendid surges rollicking up the bay.
Each roller seemed to travel faster than the one
in front, and over-rode it in a shower of spray.
The salt in the air was so sharp that it stung the
eyes, and the life in it blew the spirit out of its
shell; but he wasn’t strong enough to face that
yet. There was a summer tide that he wanted to
see, too, a full, blue tide with a ripple all over
its face, breaking in long, crisp waves along
the sand. This tide was the most human tide<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>
of all, a live, beautiful thing that you could
almost clasp.... The waves, where they broke
on the sand, were like slender bars of amethyst
crested with snow.... But the tide that was
coming out of that quiet west would never
break; it would barely even lip at sand or wall.
Hardly the wisest would know the moment
when the deep sea sent it out. There would
be no bull-roar to herald its approach, topped
by the vicious hissing-note of surf. It would
not even whisper when it rounded the point,
and scarcely a line would come on the sand to
show that it was there. A sleeping water,
shallow and very smooth, it would steal and
spread like the shadow of a cloud. Without
fear and without hurry it would come, like the
light that spreads before the sun has topped the
hill. If the moon came up, there would be a
golden glass where there had just been sand;
but if there was no moon, only the river would
know about the tide.</p>

<p>“Tide’s low,” Bob said, and the peace of the
evening came back.</p>

<p>But, beautiful as the journey had been, he
was beginning to wish that it would come to an
end. That sudden shock seemed to have drained
his strength and left him afraid of the fear
within a fear. He would have nothing to say
to the house if he was tired, and no number of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
perfect after-days could make up for the wonder
of that first glad hour. He might even miss
the first sight of it, perhaps, if his eyes should
remember that they were really old. His brain
might be numb or vacant at the first crossing
of the door. It might be only a tired old man
that would stagger in, thinking of nothing but
supper and then bed....</p>

<p>He tried to rest his eyes by shutting them for
a while, but found that he suffered more from
the jolting of the trap. Every jerk of the horse
seemed to startle his heart and hurt his bones,
as well as stirring again the thought of that
sleeping fear. And yet, as soon as he opened
his eyes, his mind was off once more. Even the
grass could not grow, nor the road wind, without
setting his memories running out of the past.</p>

<p>It was strange that he should have the fear
of the sea so strong on him to-night, when all
around him was calm and evening gold. He had
never been afraid of the sea when he had it
under his feet. Once he had gone to play at a
dance across the sands, and had sailed home
again at break of day. He had come away
from the hot room with the dancing still in his
brain, and gone down to the forsaken, dream-like
shore. It was black under the chestnuts
roofing the narrow path, but a grey light stood
over the tide that seemed to grow upward from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
the sea. The water broke crisply and coolly
at his feet as he stumbled over the beach and
came to the sand. Near to him, like a figure
flung on a cloud, a man was holding a vague
and ghostly boat, and out on the dim tide where
it merged into the air, a shadowy ship pulled at
a shadowy rope. She, too, was the merest
phantasm of herself, with her spidery cords
and nebulous mast and spars. It was impossible
to believe that she could support the pressure
of a foot, so that the life and lift in her as
he scrambled aboard came with a shock of
exquisite surprise. His body and brain felt
heavy as lead against the lightness of her build,
and yet the effect of his weight was merely an
increased impression of her buoyant strength.
His mind, that was still full of whirling sounds,
swayed to the water-floor on which she rode.
From the elastic spring of her under his feet,
it seemed as if she must leap into the air as soon
as she was released. Turned as she was on her
anchor to meet the tide, she swung on her heel
the moment she felt the sail, and was off like a
racer before the flag is down. The boat dropped
from them and became a blur, and the line of
shore was blurred, and the climbing town. The
few dim lights that burned were still to be seen
after the shapes of the houses had been painted
out, showing mistily yellow above the sea, like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>
lamps in the long slits of a castle wall. Then
they, too, went as if suddenly blown out, and
only the cap of pine that crowned the hill spoke
to the presence of earth against the sky. Kit
was a crouched shadow in the boat, staring ahead
of him for a sight of the marsh, but the great,
grey wing of the sail seemed spread across the
world. The wind was behind them and they
fled hushed, as shadows of clouds move silently
on the sea. The motion was easing as sleep, and
healing as still prayer. He thought of the
dancing figures in the town which had seemed
so beautiful to him while he watched, yet were
earthy and clumsy and slow compared with
this. Even the music—even the fiddle itself—seemed
noisy beside that delicate wash at the
keel. This was the peace of the sea of which
men spoke, this great and painless detachment
from things of the earth. In the wide spaces
how easily God was found! On the water, as
in the mountains and on the Hill of Light, it
was good for men to be there. Sometimes he
slept for a few moments, and awakened again
and slept, but the man at the tiller neither
moved nor slept. He was like a statue set in
the low stern, with the straight shadow of the
helm stretching between them like a bar. His
eyes were lifted a little towards the sail, and the
slack of the sheet lay in his quiet hand. Each<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>
time that Kit awoke the grey had changed,
because of the light over the hills that as yet
he could not see. The light came into it as out
of an emptied cup, like a white wine teemed in
a sombre, misted pool. Slowly, as the land came
back to the sea, he could see the lake mountains
piled into the sky, all turned to wait for the
coming light from the east, but even before he
could trace them he was sure they turned. It
was strange to look into the blackness where he
knew them to be, and think of the dark shapes
waiting in a crowd. So huge they were, and
solid and old, homes alike for the short-living
and the long dead. Perhaps they saw, whom
others, through the mist of morning, could not
see. It was like being watched by giants with
many eyes.</p>

<p>But he was altogether alone when he forgot
the hills, because the steersman was only a
part of the boat. Even the wind had nothing to
say in this silent world, and the water was like
a monster moving floor, rushing them poised
on its expanse. So light they felt, he and the
boat, and yet through every plank he could feel
the passionate quiver of taut strength. The
sail whitened as the light whitened, and the
mast grew yellow instead of grey. Then a level
line cut across the threads of rope, and behind
it arose the misty country of the marsh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span></p>

<p>The sun came, bringing the clean first colour
of all, that for its purity alone is sufficient
miracle and joy. Slowly at first, and then
faster and faster all the time it lifted the earth
out of the many-shaded grey. Here and there
and then there the land showed itself awake,
glowing in great breadths in this place and
then in that. Not all at once was the colour
painted in, but gradually, as if waiting for the
eye to catch the effect of green stretches and
white walls, and the sudden blue-grey of jutting
rock. The mountains weighed heavier and
heavier upon the earth, showing their great
bones and russet bracken slopes.</p>

<p>The kiss of the sun on the sail seemed to waken
the statue into life, showing him wiry and lithe,
with the blue of a warmer water in his eyes.
After the marsh stood up he came about, and at
once the world was all struggle and noise, straining
and drumming canvas overhead, and hissing
and bubbling water under the bow. The boat
felt stiff from stem to stern, a passionate live
thing set against control. She leaned over, as
if bent on ridding herself of her human freight,
and let the water line up and slap itself over
their feet. The sail was gleaming now, and the
bay deepening into blue, and suddenly Kit saw
the dazzling front of his home, with the yew
sharp-cut and black against its side. It had the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>
rippling tide before it and the shining river
behind, and where there was neither river nor
tide there were green fields and thick hedges
and white roads.... Faint at the upstairs
window, he thought he saw a face....</p>

<p>Now they had found the channel and were
coming at the house, rushing and winged as they
had been before, such a flying thing of the deep
as Agnes had once seen. It seemed to Kit, as
it had seemed to her, that they would ride on
that moving water straight into the house itself.
The boat raced towards it as a horse towards a
fence, only smoother and swifter and keener
than any horse. He clambered out to the bow
and knelt on the seat, and felt the ride and lift
of her over the carrying sea. Kneeling, he
thought of ancient figureheads, and knew what
they had felt and why they stood for the whole
exultation of the world.... It was plain to
him what he should do when they rose at
the house. The flung-back casement upstairs
was like a sign, and behind it the face
still glimmered and watched and leaned.
Straight out of the boat, as she lifted under
his feet, he would step unhurriedly into the
room....</p>

<p>He rose from his knees and stood erect,
supremely prepared, and fell in a clutching heap
as they came about. For a moment he sat still,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>
grasping at his wits, confounded by violent
defraudation and shock. Now they were hove
to under the farmyard wall, but it did not seem
to him that they had really arrived. The boat
seemed limp and broken, injured though not
dead, a flapping, fretting thing checked in its
flight before the goal was reached. He felt a
blinding spasm of rage as if he had been robbed,
and even when he stood on the shore and watched
the boat beat back, he was still cheated and
angry in his heart. Now he was conscious that
he was very tired, just a weary player coming
home in the dawn. He turned at last and walked
slowly to the house, and was glad of the open
doorway in his path. As he walked he looked
at the window upstairs, but without either
exaltation or desire. He had been so near
perfection, as it seemed, and at the impossible
moment it had escaped. The room was still
there, but his passionate impulse towards it
had died down. In youth one seeks one’s
sacred place on wings; it is only in later
life that it is sweet to climb to it by a homely
stair.</p>

<p>Bob had stopped the horse and scrambled
down, and was busy with the latch of a gate.
Kit brought himself back to the present with a
jerk, though the floor of the trap was still the
light, curving timbers of the yacht. In front of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
him was a long, green road, a wide alley hedged
on either side, with the dykes beside the hedges
so full of growth that they looked almost level
with the level road. The hedges themselves, as
far as he could see, were pink with little rose-faces
and purple with vetch. Now they were
nearly home; the green road always meant
that they were nearly home. Bob took the
horse by the head and called to his father to take
the reins, and he gathered them up shakingly,
glad, after so long, to feel the touch of the
rough leather against his hands. But all the
time he was troubled by a sense of something
amiss, in spite of the green road that meant
the journey’s end. He wondered why he had
lived again that vivid experience on the boat.
The shadow of that disillusionment long ago
seemed stretching also across this perfect
hour.</p>

<p>And then gradually his mind cleared again,
and set the warning and creeping trouble aside.
There came back to him like a repeated song
the sweetness of this tranquil evening return.
The grass crushed softly underneath the wheels,
and on the quiet road there was peace for the
creaking bones of the ancient trap. He felt
warm in the sun and soothed and freshened by
the tender air. The light was gold on the dark
coat of the horse, and on Bob’s stooping shoulders<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>
and bent head. Yet behind all the comfort of
renewed content he felt continually that he
was very tired. The journey had been a long
one—longer than he had thought; perhaps he
would never have come if he had known how
long. Those mind-travels of his had been easier
by far, when his body was left behind and
nothing jolted or jarred. He was perfectly
certain that he could never face it again, but
then he was done with all his journeying
now. He was at home; he had escaped
Marget; he was at home. It did not matter
how tired you were when once you had reached
home.</p>

<p>The green road ran out from between its
hedges close in front, and seemed to be lost in
a stretch of open field. It looked, like the rest
of the old man’s span of life, as if it ran smoothly
to the end, yet all the while the river lay between
field and road. Often enough, folks
coming home in the dark had gone over the
sheer drop into its hidden bed. Kit tightened
the reins nervously when he came to the bank,
and Bob felt the tug on the bit and glanced
behind. The old man was out of himself to-night,
he thought, and as full of the shakes as
a piece of doddering grass. First of all, he had
boggled at the sea, and here he was taking
steck at the river, too! He turned the horse<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>
to the left, and stopped again, at a meadow
gate. Thomas was waiting at the meadow
gate.</p>

<p>He was up at the trap side before it came to
rest, and as his eyes fell upon him Kit felt
suddenly very old. This son of his was so lithe
and strong, so full of life at its height, so healthy
and fine-coloured and clean-drawn. There was
nothing about him that was betrayed or made
ashamed by the pure tones and line of marsh and
sky. By comparison Kit felt himself and Bob
to be broken and fusty like the trap, unbeautifully
finished things blurring the exquisitely ending
day. Not all the clean air and space could give
them back that look, which belongs only to
Nature and the young. They were blots on the
landscape, he felt, an offence to the eye ...
like an old boot flung away in a flowering hedge
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">... old bottles cast on the emptiness of the</span><br>
sands....</p>

<p>Thomas, however, was reaching up a hand,
and there was nothing but hearty greeting in
his face. He kept saying, “You’ve landed,
dad—you’ve landed at last!” as if it was
something brought about by a charm. He
managed to spare Bob a jerk of the head, and
then instantly turned to the older man again.
Bob looked at them both with a somewhat
curious stare—the brother that seemed so hearty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>
and so glad, and the father that was out of
himself to-night.</p>

<p>Kit said, “Ay, ay,” in a voice that was rather
vague and tired, because now he was looking
past Thomas at the gate. He had not noticed
the gate when they first stopped, because of
that withering picture of Thomas in his strength,
but now he saw that it was not the gate he knew.
It was either a new gate straight from the Hall
works, or else it was the old one mended and put
to rights. It was painted, too, which in any
case would have made it strange, because it
was many a long year since Kit had painted
his gates. Perhaps he should have welcomed
this first symbol of advance, but instead he felt
coldly angry with the four-ruled thing, swinging
so neatly on its stoup. He was accustomed to
broken and jagged and hanging bars, made
lovely in velvet greens by the brushes of wind
and rain. Always, on coming home, he had seen
the house through the bars, the painted colours
of home through the ancient, mellow frame.
Sunset he had seen through the old bars—long
lines of yellow in a frosty sky, and the red ball
of the sun dropping fierily over snow. He had
seen pure morning and sepia afternoon, and the
wild smokes of stormy dusks in spring, and the
old gate had vignetted them softly, as the soft
lines of the hedges framed the fields. But it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>
was not possible to look at the house through
this soulless square, cutting the scene like a
knife with its hard blue lines. Now there came
to him, as on the yacht, the sense of violent
robbery at a journey’s end. Just here he had
meant to stand and stare, to yield to the first
ecstasy of sight, and this parvenu gate had come
brutally between. He glared at it so fiercely
that Thomas asked what was wrong, but Kit
only said, “Nowt, nowt,” and allowed him to
help him down. Bob looked at him from beside
the horse’s head, watching with curious, half-shut
eyes.</p>

<p>Thomas did not appear to notice that the
other two scarcely spoke. He was so busy
with his welcome, so full of a rather nervous
pleasure and intense relief. He talked all the
time he was helping the old man down, and
after he had him safely on the ground. “You’ll
be a bit stiff, likely, but you’re rarely lish....
Watch out for yon step, now—ay, yon’s it!
You’ve brought fiddle along wi’ you?—ay,
there it be. Catch hold of my arm, and we’ll
get along to t’house.”</p>

<p>Agnes had been right in supposing that Bob
would not come in. Thomas pressed him a
little, but he shook his head, and turned the horse
and climbed back into the trap. Once there,
however, he did not drive away, but sat watching<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>
his father with that new knowledge in his
face. Thomas thought he was hesitating, after
all, and went back to him when he had led the
old man through the gate, but Bob only bent a
little over the wheel, and told him something in
a lowered tone. Both remembered, as they
looked at each other, another evening on the
marsh....</p>

<p>Kit stayed where Thomas had planted him
in the track, looking in front of him towards
the mountains and the sea. Now he could look
at the house without anything in between, and
forget the shock of the gate that swung behind.
The house, at least, seemed just as it had been,
true to his trust and faithful to his dream.
Just so it had looked a thousand days before,
with the yew’s tall finger pointing to the sky.
Even in his most absent moods he had never
neglected the yew, but had managed to keep
it smooth as a quill pen. He had liked to see
its shadow fall clean against the house, the one
thing black and sharp in his coloured, shifting
life. Windows and roofs he saw, orchard and
yard; garden and hedge and the white penthouse
of the porch. The light lay over it all
like the blessing of a hand, and when he came
to it, it would bless him, too. Just for a moment,
however, he watched it from afar, comparing
it, inch by inch, with the picture in his heart.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>
No, it had not failed him, in spite of his fear,
and he was safe. The substance had not broken
in his fingers and crushed the dream. A passion
of thankfulness swept over him as he stood,
and then, turning to look for Thomas, he saw
the gate.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="IV">IV</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">They went arm-in-arm along the meadow
path, the young and the old masters of
Beautiful End. Thomas had always been a
silent soul, but now he talked as if he would
never stop. Every now and then he laughed as
well, a satisfied, happy chuckle in his throat.
Also he acted showman, which was hard to
bear, and Kit said “Ay” and “Nay,” and
looked the other way. He wished with all his
heart that Thomas would stop pointing and
hold his tongue. He did not want to be shown
things; most passionately he did <em>not</em>. He could
find what he wanted for himself, and see it as
Thomas could never see it, if he tried for the
rest of his life. There was no use in showing
things at any time, if it came to that, because
no two persons saw them just the same. Thomas
was equally busy pointing out what was new,
and introducing old friends, as it were, by the
scruff of the neck. Thomas had been off at
service from a lad, yet here he was teaching
his father about the farm, although Kit had
never ceased seeing it since he went away. Did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>
he remember the three old trees in a clump,
and how deep the river ran below the house?
Glimpses of bay and moss ... his own fields
... things that were closer than breathing
and nearer than hands and feet! He was
ashamed of himself for being irritated and
vexed, because, of course, Thomas was only
meaning to be kind. It wasn’t every son who
would do so much for a thriftless dad, and he
didn’t know he was spoiling things at the start.
He must just be allowed to talk himself to a
stop, and then perhaps they would have a little
peace. He would surely get tired of pointing,
after a bit. There was nothing to do but say
“Ay” and look away.</p>

<p>The meadow was altered, somehow, he said
to himself, though just for the moment he was
puzzled to say why. It had a smoother and
greener look than he remembered it to have worn,
though at the same time it seemed somehow
rather bare. “There’s a deal less thistles than
there used,” he said, when he understood, and
Thomas laughed and nodded his head with
pride.</p>

<p>“Ay, and there’ll be fewer still afore I’m
through.” His eyes went keenly across the
meadow and over the land, seeing things as his
father would never see them, if he tried for the
rest of his life. “I’ve not made a job of it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>
yet, not by a deal, but there’s over much to
take in hand right off. I just went for t’things
as was worst, and t’others mun just make shift
and bide their time. I’d ha’ liked to have had
the whole place sided afore you come, but yon
was a bigger bite than I could chew....”</p>

<p>There was a warm satisfaction in his voice
in spite of his words, for he had done wonders
already, as, of course, he knew. Already the
farm had a look of care such as it had not worn
for many a long year. He could not help feeling
proud that it had changed its face even in so
short a time, and was perfectly sure that his
father would be proud as well. Kit, however,
seemed scarcely to notice what he said, but
was busy staring at the cattle under the
hedge.</p>

<p>“What’s come to old Bonny?” he demanded,
suddenly stopping short in the rough track.
“You’ve never gone and parted with her,
surely—a rare good cow like yon?”</p>

<p>“I never had her to part with,” Thomas said,
with a look of surprise. “Bonny’s been dead a
while back, father, if you come to think on.
Even the best can’t last for ever, and Bonny
had her spell.”</p>

<p>“It’s the first I’ve heard on it,” Kit replied
in a vexed tone. He stared aggrievedly at the
new stock, as if the blame of his disappointment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>
was somehow theirs. “What d’ye think it was
as took her off at the last?”</p>

<p>“Nobbut old age, I reckon!” Thomas said,
with a laugh. “What, it was not so long afore
you give up the farm! You’ve never gone and
forgotten yon, I’m sure!”</p>

<p>“Ay, I reckon I have,” Kit said in a voice
like a full stop, and stared for a while longer at
the drowsy group, before he turned away and
left them in the sun. He remembered now, of
course, that Bonny was dead, and was deeply
ashamed of his lapse and his daft talk. It was
just that he had forgotten that things change,
because in his dream of home there was never
any change. Everything in it had been as stable
as the stars, even such creatures of time as
thistles and cows. But he couldn’t let Thomas
think he was fretting after the past, so presently
he made an effort to speak again. “Seemingly
you’ve a decent bit o’ stock,” he said. “I
reckon you’ve got an eye for the right stuff.”</p>

<p>Thomas had been conscious of a sudden chill,
but this remark brightened him at once. “Happen
I’ve not done that badly,” he answered as
modestly as he could, longing to stop again for
another stare. He wanted to drag his father
across the field, and tell him the history of each
separate beast, and how they had all been
bargains beyond belief. But there was plenty of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>
time for that, and the old man must be tired;
besides, Agnes was waiting for them at the house.</p>

<p>“I’ve always meant to go in for right good stuff,”
he said. “I always knew I’d be stock-proud
if I got the chance. Farming’s like owt else—there’s
nowt beats the best. A good roan’s my
choice—you can’t do better than yon. Your
old Bonny was a rare good cow, if nobbut she
hadn’t been white.”</p>

<p>“She suited me well enough,” Kit said, in the
tone that meant the subject was now closed,
and Thomas remembered himself and hedged
with shame. Agnes would have plenty to say,
he felt sure of that, if he put the old man about
before ever he reached the house! “There’s
always changes,” he murmured, after a while,
not knowing that he was echoing Marget and
Bob. “Farm’s in the same spot, anyway, and
the yew. Grass grows much the same colour,
I’ll be bound; and there’s always the sea, as
doesn’t change at all....”</p>

<p>Kit remembered Bob when they were halfway
to the house, and turned to look for him,
thinking him at their heels. But the track behind
them was empty and the gate shut, and there
was no more sign of Bob and his trap than if
they had never been. The old man wanted to
know why he had gone away, and Thomas looked
shy at the question, and seemed vexed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span></p>

<p>“Nay, I doubt he’s a bit put out about summat,
is Bob. Happen he’s not best suited at
you coming to us.... Any road, he wasn’t
for coming up to the house, whatever I said.
He said he’d be stopping a while at Low Moss
End, and likely getting his tea along wi’ ’em
an’ all....”</p>

<p>Kit remained standing still in the middle of
the field, looking rather forlornly down the track.
“Happen he’d a message or summat for ’em,”
he observed. “They’re cousins o’ Marget’s,
now I come to think on.” There was a lost
sound in his voice, as if he had somehow been
betrayed. “I never thought as he wouldn’t
be coming up.”</p>

<p>Thomas had come to a stand, too, looking
crestfallen and cast down. He had never
imagined for a moment that his father would
want Bob. One would have thought he had had
enough of that family and to spare! “Is there
owt you wanted to tell him?” he ventured at
last. “I could happen slip down and fetch him
as soon as I’ve had my tea.”</p>

<p>But before he had stopped speaking Kit had
swung round, shaking his head and making
for the house. Now he seemed to be running
away from Bob, thrusting him into the distance
that lay behind. He wondered why he had
asked for his elder son, and why he had felt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>
deserted when he saw the empty field. Bob
was the last connecting link with what he had
left, and he couldn’t be really free until Bob
had gone. He ought to have felt exultant
instead of afraid, but there was no trusting his
wretched nerves to-night. He felt ashamed of
himself again ... he was always feeling ashamed.
He was the sort that would try to escape on the
threshold of Paradise itself....</p>

<p>He breathed more easily when they reached
the garden gate, because it did not seem possible
that he could turn back now, and he saw with
relief that the gate was still the same. It was
painted, indeed, in the new shade of blue, but
that did not prevent it from being the same
gate underneath. He knew it to be the same
by the missing spoke, which must have been
missing for over twenty years. Thomas apologised
for the spoke, but he paid no heed; he
was so busy gloating over the fact that it wasn’t
there.</p>

<p>He hurried between the box borders along the
path, and all the sweet scents of the garden
came to him, and the homely, well-known odours
of the farm. There was lavender somewhere,
wallflower, mignonette; sweet briar, faint salt
from the far sea, and the scent of the ready
grass asking for the scythe. Now he was close
to the whitewashed porch, with its stone seats<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span>
and its arch of rose, and the little beds at its
feet that were full of snowdrops in the spring.
Then he was inside the porch, in the stream of
gold that went swimming through the door,
and felt himself shabby and poor in the purity
of the light. He was like a threadbare tramp,
he thought to himself, being carried up to
Heaven in a chariot of fire.... The kitchen
seemed dim and narrow to him after the open
marsh, or else his eyes were weakened by weariness
and sun. Nothing came out or spoke to
him as he stood, waiting for the first tremendous
swelling of joy. In the old days the peace of
the house had been so free that it had never
hidden itself until he was inside. It had come
out to meet him before he reached the porch, like
a child that runs to a father coming home.
To-night the kitchen was empty and very quiet,
but it was an aloof stillness, self-absorbed ...
detached. The voice of the grandfather’s clock
in the silence spoke as if speaking only to itself.
He, too, now that he was under the roof, felt
curiously detached. Only half of him, he felt,
was in the house; the other—the dreaming
half—was left outside. But still he hoped and
stood, waiting for the uprising of his heart,
and Thomas, respectfully sympathetic, waited
too. Perhaps it was because of Thomas that the
magic would not work. Suddenly he began to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>
feel self-conscious under his son’s eyes, and the
fear that was fear of a fear came drifting back.
Shrinking, he took a hasty plunge through the
kitchen door, and caught his foot on a flag as
he went in.</p>

<p>Thomas, following, found him just inside,
puzzling and staring worriedly at the floor.
“Summat catched my foot,” he was saying
repeatedly with a pained surprise. He bent
down to the flag as if wishing to test it with his
hand as well as his feet. “I never mind catching
my foot afore,” he said. It was just as if he
couldn’t believe he had done the thing, as if
his boots had been bound to know the flag—the
same old boots—all patched—that he had
been wearing when he left. But he and the
boots had forgotten because they were old, and
the flag had forgotten the memory of his tread.
It did not do to fret about these things, because
perhaps they always happened to folks who
went away. Marget, at least, would have
told him so, he knew. Nevertheless, the trivial
little mischance weighed upon his mind. It
was like some base betrayal on the part of
ancient friends.</p>

<p>“You’re a bit shaky, likely,” Thomas said,
dumping the bundle on the nearest chair. He
blinked his eyes a moment because of the sun,
and then he began to look about for his wife.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>
He couldn’t persuade himself at first that she
wasn’t there, because this was the great moment
of which she had talked. He had almost expected
to meet her in the field, or at least to
discover her waving from the porch. Failing
that, they would find her when they got inside,
ready with welcome for a tired old man. Here
they were, however, at the journey’s end, only
to find her vanished off the earth. Not only
was she not in the kitchen as he had thought,
but he had a terrible feeling that she wasn’t
even in the house. There was no stir in the air
of the kitchen as though somebody had just
run out. The silence of it was settled and whole,
and seemed to flow away into unstirred deeps
beyond. Just for a moment he felt his old
loneliness crush back, thinking her shut away
from him where he could not go. Then he
roused himself and went to the stair and called,
and Kit stopped staring at the flag and shuffled
into the room. There he stood and waited, as
he had learned to wait, with his careless-careful
fingers clasping fiddle and bow. The kitchen
still seemed dim and rather strange, and nothing
spoke to him out of it that he knew. The sun
sent pointers of light across the room, picking
out tables and chairs he had never seen.</p>

<p>Thomas shouted and said she wouldn’t be
far; and shouted again and said she wouldn’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>
be long. This sudden check at the very start
seemed to have thrown all their pleasant planning
out of gear. The great occasion couldn’t
begin until Agnes was in place, and as far as he
could discover she was gone for good. He
thought, as he waited and fretted, that things
were going amiss ... right from the earliest
moment they were going amiss....</p>

<p>He said over and over again that she wouldn’t
be far, just as Kit had repeated his speech about
the flag. They were like helpless, stranded
actors dropping cues that there was nobody
left in the theatre to pick up. Then Thomas
bellowed again in the midst of a last excuse,
and they heard a door fling open above them
and afterwards slam. There was a running
and flutter and clatter on the stair, and Agnes
came flying past him into the room.</p>

<p>She went straight across to the guest and
took his hand, her face warm with welcoming
smiles, and her voice full of self-reproach. “Eh,
now, to think I missed you after all!” she said;
“an’ me that set on being on the spot! I never
thought you’d catch me unbeknownst. I was
nobbut giving a look to things upstairs....
Ay, well, you’re welcome, I’m sure ... you
are that. We’re right glad, Thomas and me,
to have you come....”</p>

<p>She still had hold of the hand which he left<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>
limply in her clasp, and he looked at her smiling
face and said “Thank you,” and smiled too.
The kindliness of her welcome warmed his
heart, though it was not the welcome he wanted
from the house. It was like the welcome from
the cottages in the row, which was pleasant and
comforting but had nothing to do with home.
Agnes was mistress of the place, but she was a
stranger, too, and no stranger could give you
the real feeling of home. She had never been
in the house when he went in his dream, and
now that she spoke in the dream it was bound
to seem strange. But she was pleasant to look
at, and homely, and very kind, and she would
grow to be part of the real things after a while.
So when she continued to smile he smiled again,
and Thomas smiled joyfully over by the stair.
Perhaps there was just a touch of self-satisfaction
in the smile, because he was thinking of
Marget’s welcome home. Anyhow, they had
done the old man better than that, even if Agnes
had been off the spot! He forgot, as he watched,
that he had been afraid, that things had seemed
to be going utterly wrong. He only remembered
that they were perfect now—the house, the
weather, and the kindly wife. Certainly, it
would be queer if his father wasn’t content ...
but then he was positive he would be content....</p>

<p>Agnes was sure of it, at least, sure as triumphant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>
angels gathering tired souls into heaven.
Now she was laughing and repeating her first
speech—it was curious how they repeated themselves
to-night. Then she flew to the hearth
and set the kettle back to boil, afterwards
swinging round to put the visitor into his chair.</p>

<p>“Set you down, Father, and I’ll make the
tea. You’ll be wanting your tea, I reckon,
after yon drive. Now, then, Thomas, shove it
nearer the fire, and don’t stand poping like a
pig at a punch! There you be, Father ...
champion ... now you’ll do. Shall I put
fiddle down for you, by the way?”</p>

<p>He looked at her as she stood in front of him,
holding out her hand, and a look of anxious
terror crossed his face. It was true that she
looked like the lasses who had loved the fiddle
in the past, but that was before he had learned
to be afraid. Still, this was home, and to refuse
was to be false to the dream from the very first,
because home was a place where every man’s
foolishness was safe. “You’ll mind what you’re
at?” he pleaded, searching her with his eyes,
and she nodded her head wisely, and for the
first time did not smile. Taking it gently, she
set it on a table near, and there was no tremor
of nervousness from the strings. She nodded
again as she turned away, as though the fiddle
was a secret that they shared....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span></p>

<p>“I’m feared to let it out o’ my sight,” Kit
explained in an apologetic tone. “Marget was
that set on shoving it in the fire.”</p>

<p>“Ay, well, it’ll be safe enough here,” Agnes
said. “It’ll be safe as the Bible and precious
as bright gold.” She went to a brass-handled
drawer and whipped out a snowy square of a
cloth which she laid across the strings. “Thomas
mun make you a box for it,” she went on; “a
nice warm box as’ll keep it out o’ the damp.”</p>

<p>Thomas said he would start on it first thing,
in a tone that meant he was glad of something
to say. Of course he was quite sure now, as
Agnes was sure, but as yet he could not copy
her conversational ease. “A grand warm box’ll
be just the ticket,” he said. “It’ll be better
and snugger a deal when it’s gitten a box.”</p>

<p>Kit said they were right kind, and settled
himself in his chair, staring in front of him at
the shining hearth. He did not like to say that
he would not have the box, and that he hated
to see the fiddle covered up. The white cloth
looked for all the world like a little shroud, and
the box would be only a coffin in his eyes. He
did not mean to have the box whatever they
said, but it wouldn’t be manners to tell them so
right off. There seemed no letting him and his
fiddle alone, though all that folks could do for
him was to let him alone. It was just the way<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>
Thomas had bothered him in the field, showing
him things he didn’t want to see. Well, he would
slip away from them later on, but now he must
mind his manners and let be.</p>

<p>He roused himself with a little attempt at
cheer. “Ay, well, I’ve landed at last!” he
said, with a smile. “I never thought I’d see
the old spot again.”</p>

<p>Thomas and Agnes gave him a double beam.
“It’s a sight for sore eyes to see you here, I’m
sure!”</p>

<p>“Marget wasn’t best pleased at me coming
away,” the old man said. “She’s had a deal
to say about it, these last few week.”</p>

<p>“And wi’ the rough side of her tongue for
it, I’ll swear!” Thomas laughed. “I heard
tell she was taking on and terble wild. Ay,
well, you’ll have none o’ that wi’ Agnes, don’t
you fret.”</p>

<p>Agnes threw him a laughing glance, and said
it was early days to talk like that. Happen, if
he waited, she would show him different, later
on. Thomas, however, wasn’t to be put off.
“There isn’t a smarter lass in the country-side,”
he said, “and she’s a rare hand at managing a
house.” The showman in him was aching to be
out, and he was driven as well by an urgent
need that he didn’t know how to explain. It
was as if he was bent upon manufacturing a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span>
barrier of good things, an insurmountable
barrier of comforts and kind words.... He had
a sense of delicacy about beginning to praise
the house, but it couldn’t be taken amiss if he
praised his wife. “She’ll do you that well
you’ll think you’re the king,” he said, “and
she’s as bonny as they make ’em, as you can
see for yourself.”</p>

<p>“Marget’s not much in the way o’ looks,”
Kit said. “She’s the cankert sort, is Marget,
wi’ a nippit nose.”</p>

<p>Thomas laughed and said it was just as well
she couldn’t hear, but the bitter disparagement
gave him a slight shock. It had never been like
his father to say bitter things. He had had a
good word for every erring soul, a tolerant
explanation for every doubtful deed. Marget
must have been dreadful indeed to have altered
him like that. The thought of his own share in
the matter troubled Thomas’s heart. “Bob’s
catched a Tartar,” he added, after a while.
“He darsent call his soul his own, poor lad!”</p>

<p>“Ay, she keeps folk stirring, Marget does,”
Kit said, but after his little outburst he sat
quiet. It was strange how Marget was present
with him even here, so that he could not so
much as open his mouth but she came jumping
out. He tried to put her away from him as he
watched Agnes moving about the hearth, all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span>
colour and curves and deft handling and neat
ways. Agnes was flushed with the excitement
of the occasion, and her eyes shone when she
smiled. He could not remember that he had
ever seen Marget smile except for the purpose
of a sneer. She had never even smiled at the
red-haired baby or Bob, and certainly not at
the daft old man who was only a burden in the
house. He liked a smiling face, but it embarrassed
him as well, because he had forgotten
what to do with people who smiled. That
was why he shifted his eyes when Agnes looked
his way, though he watched her again as soon
as she left him alone. He liked her air of hurry
without fuss, which filled the room with a vigour
that did not fret. Marget would have spilt the
kettle over the fender and one of the brats,
and in the midst of the hissing and howling
would have blamed himself. Somehow he could
not picture Agnes ever spilling a drop. She
brought the grand new tea-pot to be filled on
the hearth, and the room was reflected in its
polished side. Her blue gown, crossing and
crossing the bars of gold, made him think of a
coloured bird that kept flashing through the
sun. From his window at Marget’s he had
often watched the swifts darting and dipping
in the evening light. The tiny whir of their
wings across the pane had come to him in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>
series of little shocks. The long, pointed wings
were like little slender swords, crossing and
darting and never getting home. Now, if he
looked from the farm-window, he would see
the birds of the marsh, the long legs of the heron
and the stately swing of the gull. The redshank
and the curlew he would see lonely on the sands
... yet here he was busy thinking of Marget’s
and the swifts.</p>

<p>It seemed as if the farther he went away from
Marget’s the closer it followed up. Just at first
he had seemed to leave it right behind, and yet
in the heart of the dream it was waiting on the
step. The one door of the viaduct that he had
seen still wide had not succeeded in closing,
after all. That meant that, when he went to
bed, he would not be safe, because Marget
might come and peer at him as he slept. The
thing that might have swamped her and shut
her out had not so much as begun to come to
pass. He could not conjure her out of the house,
because magic had failed him as he stepped
inside. If there was anything there that belonged
to himself, it had done nothing for him
yet but make him sad. Yet he couldn’t help
feeling that the joy was only slightly out of
reach; as if he looked at it through a window,
but could not come inside. His heart was heavy,
as heavy as wet grass. Nothing, he told himself,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span>
was going right. Even the chair he sat in
wasn’t right.</p>

<p>“I doubt I mun be getting old bones,” he
said at last. “Chair don’t seem to fit me same
as it used.”</p>

<p>Thomas had been busy with a contented little
whistled tune, but he broke it off in the middle
when his father spoke. “’Tisn’t the old chair,
dad,” he said, a little abashed. “Yon went wi’
the rest o’ the furniture at the sale.”</p>

<p>Kit stared at him a moment with a puzzled
frown, and then, as if still at a loss, he dropped
his gaze to the chair. Thomas saw that he was
thinking hard as he ran his hands repeatedly
over the arms. While he was at Marget’s he
had remembered many sales, but apparently he
had never remembered his own. In those
crowds of his he had seen many a chair sold,
but his own had never come to the hammer
under his eyes. How could it do anything of
the sort when it had stayed safely in the dream,
waiting in the house until he should come back?
Yet it had vanished, after all, when the dream
had come about, and there was only this false
pretender in its place. When he stopped
rubbing the arms he peered at the legs, and
twisted round to stare at the leather back. It
was a shop-chair, that was plain, varnished and
hard-stuffed, unyielding as old bread. It almost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span>
seemed to reject him as he sat, refusing the
purpose for which it had been made. It was
handsome enough to look at, of its kind, making
a great show with leather and brass nails, but
as yet it was only an effigy of a chair. No ghost
as yet had clung to its hard seat, those stubborn
ghosts which hammers couldn’t eject. No
shadowy arms would steal and clasp him round
as he sighed himself asleep on a twilit afternoon.
It was a mindless chair, a chair without a soul,
the price of which was the sacrifice of death.
Generations must use it before it grew a soul;
lover sitting on lover’s knee, children clambering
about its legs. Dreams of the winter
dusk would have to shut it round; the sick,
the dying, console themselves in its arms. There
was a long education before the new arm-chair,
and he himself was the sacrifice it
asked....</p>

<p>“House is furnished every bit new,” Thomas
said. “But I got chair as near the old one as
I could.”</p>

<p>“Oh, ay, it’s a grand chair, thank ye—real
smart.”</p>

<p>“Nay, I doubt it isn’t much, but it’s the
best we’ve got.”</p>

<p>“Marget wouldn’t ha’ let me set in the best
chair.”</p>

<p>“You shall set where you like, Father, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span>
<em>this</em> house!” Agnes flashed. “It’s queer if
you can’t do as suits you best, I’m sure!”</p>

<p>Kit said she was right kind, and let his arms
lie slackly along the arms of the new chair.
The bright leather was cool and slippery to his
sensitive old hands. The old chair had been
covered with carpet that was rough to the
touch—dark green and threadbare in many
spots, with a pattern of ringed daisies centred
by a faded rose.... It was all very well to
say that he might choose; he was pinned to
this new horror, nevertheless. Not here, any
more than at Marget’s, could he sit exactly
where he wished....</p>

<p>“Likely you’ve noticed we’ve a new kitchen
range? Landlord said it was t’best as could
be got.”</p>

<p>“Ay, I see it first thing,” Kit said, and looked
away.</p>

<p>“Walls is new-washed, of course, and paint’s
new, too. Yon old winder-sash gone——”</p>

<p>“Ay.”</p>

<p>“—new sink in back kitchen ... cupboards
... carpet on t’stairs——”</p>

<p>Agnes made a noise with the pot, and said
the tea was mashed and they’d best set to.
It was just like Thomas to spoil her pet surprise,
but luckily it passed the old man by.
He rose to his feet obediently when she spoke,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span>
and was set at the table, still in the hated chair.
Agnes was telling him he wanted his tea, and
he tried to agree with her, knowing that he lied.
The light from the west still lay across the
room, and blinded and hurt his unaccustomed
eyes. He could not see the table as Agnes hoped
he might—as she herself saw it with an artist’s
pride. For her, every detail stood out on the
whiteness of the cloth, coloured and glorified
by the clear sun. The light was cool as water
on china and polished plate, and rich on yellow
butter and the pink surface of the ham. There
were creamy scones and a gingerbread cake ...
lavender in a vase ... deep crimson jam and
eggs with warm brown shells. A white geranium
stood on a sill, showing the sky behind it far
and blue....</p>

<p>Thomas carved the ham and went on talking
about the house. “There’s a deal that’s new
above-stairs as well; beds and quilts and suchlike,
and a deal besides. You could eat off the
floors as easy as yon dish. Missis keeps the
place like a new pin.”</p>

<p>“Marget’s nobbut a dirty slut,” Kit said.
“Last week I come a terble bang over a pail.”</p>

<p>“Eh, now, but yon was wicked, if you like!”
Agnes’s eyes dwelt pityingly upon him as she
passed the tea. “She might ha’ finished you,”
Thomas added, handing ham.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span></p>

<p>Kit said he doubted she wouldn’t have
troubled if she had, and sat back, staring vacantly
at his plate. His face looked worn and white
now that the expression of almost venomous
hate had died away. Thomas, busily carving,
heard the hate in his voice, and again was
conscious of a little shock. Kit himself was as
puzzled by his vehemence as his son was jarred.
Never before had he even thought of Marget in
the terms he had used to-day. His tongue,
like the rest of his body, had been in jail, and
was only now beginning to be loosed. Yet his
look was not the look of a man who was brooding
on the past. That savage face belonged to a
man in an unknown place ... betrayed....</p>

<p>And then he was back in the past, away from
Beautiful End, back in the cottage where Marget’s
pails lay hoping for his feet. This one
had lurked in secret on the stair, and he had
come on it hoping, and hurtled into space.
Afterwards he and the fiddle sat on the bottom
step, shaking and crying together in their pain.
Nobody came near them however long they
cried, though once the face of a neighbour
showed scared beyond the door. Presently
he had climbed the stair and gone back again
to his room—to dream of his home where pails
were kept in place. It was strange that now he
was home he should wander away, to shake and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span>
pant and cry on the bottom step. It was
strange he should long for that room now he
was here, wanting that wretchedness beyond
this grace....</p>

<p>Marget was in the mind of the others, too,
it seemed. “Bob said she was fit to scratch
when they come away,” Thomas was busy
relating to his wife. “He made sure there’d
be a row in the street, but she thought better
o’ that. All the same, there was a grand to-do
aforehand, so he said!”</p>

<p>“Jealous—that’s what it is!” Agnes answered
with a toss of the head. She gave vent to a
short laugh as well, and the laugh was a mixture
of satisfaction and contempt. Kind as she was,
and generous to a fault, she couldn’t help
gloating over Marget to-day. She and Thomas
were doing a beautiful thing, but little, sordid
thoughts kept creeping in. Somewhere at the
back of their minds they were gloating over
Marget all the time. Of course she was bound
to be jealous of their better luck—the unlovable
woman with the wretched house. It must have
irked her to see Kit driving off, knowing how
glad he was to get away. She was bound to
envy the bride with her pleasant home, her
brand-new furniture and four-pronged forks.
Those who sit in the sun are so sure of the envy
of those in the shade. In any case, Marget<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span>
could have nothing to offer that could possibly
compare. Agnes’s nature was nearly all pure
gold, but the bit of alloy that was in it sounded
in that laugh. Besides, how could she feel anything
but secure, glowing in secret over that
room upstairs?</p>

<p>The security in the laugh tempted Thomas
into further speech. There could be no harm
now in telling her the other things that Bob
had said. “Ay, but hark ye,” he added, “what
d’ye think o’ this? Bob had it the old man
mightn’t settle, after all. ‘I’ll be at Low Moss
End for an hour or two,’ he said, ‘and if he
doesn’t feel like stopping, I’ll take him back.’”</p>

<p>“Not settle, did you say?” Agnes stared
at him open-mouthed.</p>

<p>“Ay.”</p>

<p>“Take him back?”</p>

<p>“Yon’s what he said.”</p>

<p>“Well, did you ever hear the likes o’ that!”
This time the laugh was on a harder note....
“What’s wrong, Father?” she added, kindly
again, seeing the old man gazing at his cup.</p>

<p>“I doubt you’ve given me the wrong mug,
my lass. Mine was a sort o’ blue chiney, wi’ a
pink rose.”</p>

<p>“Yon went at sale an’ all,” Thomas explained,
“but I got as near a match as they had in
t’shop.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span></p>

<p>Kit said the mug was grand and would do
right well, but a little colour came in his face,
and he felt ashamed as he had done in the
field. They must be thinking he was going
daft, losing his senses because of his great age.
He kept waiting and waiting for the things
that were in his dream, and didn’t seem able
to grasp the things that were under his nose.
He winced when Thomas talked of “getting a
match,” because you couldn’t match the furniture
of a dream. Even if the mug had managed
to look the same, he would have known when
he touched it that it wasn’t his. Still, the thing
to remember was that Thomas had done his
best. “Tea’ll sup right enough out of it, I’ll
be bound,” he said. “Yon as Marget give me
was every bit cracked....”</p>

<p>“Old folks should have the best of what’s
going,” Agnes said. She knew the best was on
the table to-night, but he did not seem to be
making much of a meal. Perhaps excitement
had taken his appetite away, or more probably
he was over-tired with the slow drive. Now and
then he looked again at the alien “mug,” but
she never saw him lift it to his lips. Old folks
always wanted a little tempting to their food,
but she had been so certain he would be suited
to-night. A vague sense of disappointment
touched her mind, in spite of the fact that it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span>
was still busy with Bob’s words. “I never hear
such a thing as that about Bob!” she said
again. “Surely to goodness Father’s had
enough o’ his spot!”</p>

<p>“Ay, well, if he’s set on waiting, I reckon
nobody’ll say him nay. He’ll nobbut be throwing
away his time an’ that’ll be all.”</p>

<p>“It’s Marget’s nastiness—that’s what it is!”
Agnes frowned. “She knows he’s glad to be
shot of her, and she’s by way of having a slap.”</p>

<p>“That’s about it,” Thomas agreed, with a
nod. He was glad now that he had spoken out,
because Agnes had laid the bogey right away.
First she had laughed, and then she had gone
to the root of the matter and shown him the
cause. The shadow lying on that first good
hour had only been thrown by jealousy, after
all. Bob had seen all the changes and novelties
at the farm, and of course Agnes would know
about them, too. It was Marget who gave the
slap, as Agnes said; Bob was only the arm
through which it struck. Jealousy—that was
it; nothing but jealous lies. Under all the
roofs of the kingdom none would be happier
than Kit....</p>

<p>And Kit had fallen back again in his chair,
staring vacantly in front of him with lifeless
eyes. He was staring straight through the
window that held the rolled-back sea, but all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span>
that he really saw was a cottage-kitchen wall.
As far as he knew, he was back at Marget’s again,
at the inhospitable board which he had loathed.
Thomas saw that his plate of food was barely
touched, and that the cup of tea had never
been touched at all. His hands, lying at rest
along the cloth, pointed knife and fork towards
the roof.... His son reached a gentle finger
towards his arm, and at once he shrank away
as at a blow. Knife and fork went clattering
down as he clutched at his knee for the fiddle
that wasn’t there. Finding nothing, he glanced
furtively from his companions to the floor, and
then terror seized him, and he looked wildly
around the room. Quite suddenly he became
still again when he saw the fiddle under the
shroud. He frowned a little, and made as if to
rise; and then remembrance came into his eyes,
and he sank back. Thomas, waiting for that
moment, drew a breath of relief....</p>

<p>His voice, slow and easy, broke the last of the
spell.... “You’re getting on terble badly wi’
your tea. I doubt you’re not taking kindly to
the ham.”</p>

<p>Kit said the ham was grand, as he had said
of the cup, and the smug, terrible chair that was
waiting for him to die. He had always been
partial to ham, he said, and Marget had never
given him as much as a slice. But, all the same,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span>
he made no attempt to empty his plate, and his
knife and fork were under the table and he let
them lie. “It don’t taste quite the same as it
used,” he pleaded at last. “I reckon there’s
no pigs gangs down just like your own....”</p>

<p>He felt ashamed of himself again when he
saw the disappointment in Agnes’s face, but
she did not try to force him into eating the ham
against his will. She did not even say that
folks were hard to suit, as Marget most certainly
would have said. “Have a bit o’ butter wi’
your bread,” she coaxed instead, pushing the
shining pat within his reach, and he felt comforted
for a moment, and forgot that he had
seen Marget sitting in her place. He made a
determined effort to receive an impression of
light and space, of comfort and kindliness and
the atmosphere of home. He said to himself
peace where there was no peace, and not for
one moment did he succeed. Agnes was busy
talking about Marget again, and he pushed the
butter away and drifted back.... Nothing
had happened to rescue him from prison, after
all, and he was in danger of losing his home of
vision as well....</p>

<p>“We’ll have a trap, one o’ these days,” Agnes
was saying, “and ride round by Bob’s. Marget’ll
be madder than ever when she sees Father
getting that perked up and fat!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span></p>

<p>“He shall play fiddle all down t’road,”
Thomas grinned, “an’ Marget’ll just have to
bide and let him be!” They looked at each
other across the table and laughed, and Thomas
leaned back in his chair and chuckled and slapped
his knee. They were so busy with the picture
in their minds that they forgot to notice anything
else. “Eh, well, never mind her, poor crabt
body!” he finished at last. He took up his
knife and fork with a smile still lingering on his
face, and felt his father’s aloofness in the silence
like a chill current in a quiet stream. The fork
half-raised in the air came to a halt....
“Butter not right, neither, eh, old dad?”</p>

<p>“It’s grand butter, but I doubt it’s not like
it used. Your mother was t’best butter-maker
in t’country-side.”</p>

<p>“You must learn me different next time I
churn,” Agnes told him with a good-tempered
smile. “Likely I’ll shape to do better after a
bit.”</p>

<p>“You’re a good lass,” the old man said suddenly,
looking her in the face, and for the first
time his voice sounded warm and strong. Their
eyes met in full and happy accord, and their
smiles mingled like the smiles of intimate
friends. Their natures, each kindly and beautiful
in its way, reached out one to the other and
were enriched. Just for a moment she saw him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span>
as he had been when he was young, the affectionate,
dreamy soul whom so many had helped and
loved. He in his turn saw her as the future of
the place, the soul that was making the new
dream for the house. The beauty of kindness
and good humour and happy work, she was
bringing it all these, just as his own wife had
brought them long ago. But it was a new
beauty, and there was no place in it for him;
he had his own, and his own was quite complete.
Now he was beginning to see what he had done—how
he had wandered into another’s dream of
home. There was no room for him here unless
he was ready to renounce his own, a thing which
he had not thought possible even with death.
Already he was being punished as those are
punished who are false to their dreams; he
could neither look forward happily nor yet
behind. Suddenly he was conscious of being
stifled by the pleasant room, oppressed by the
fire and the sun and the smell of the food. His
eyes dropped wearily from the girl’s face, and
age and blankness came back to his own. “It’s
terble warm,” he said, in a fretted tone, and
pushed back his chair sharply and got to his
feet. “I’ll gang out,” he added, looking towards
the door. “I partly what think I’ll be
easier outside.”</p>

<p>Thomas pushed away his plate, though rather<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span>
regretfully, and got to his feet, too. “Ay,
do,” he answered as heartily as he could, though
he did not look at his father while he spoke. He
did not look at his wife, either, though it was
only a minute since they had laughed at each
other across the cups. He knew as well as she
that they had expected to linger over the meal,
talking so fast they were on each other’s heels,
and digging old stories together out of the past.
They had expected to hear the old man laugh
and crack his joke, but so far the laughter and
jokes had all been theirs. There descended
upon them again a stage chill, such as Thomas
had sampled on his coming in. Then, however,
the scene had waited for an actor that didn’t
appear. Now the curtain was down too soon
on a set that had been the work of months.
Thomas gulped his tea hurriedly and looked
longingly at the scones, and then looked hastily
away and felt ashamed....</p>

<p>“You’ve nobbut made a terble poor tea,”
Agnes said wistfully to the guest.</p>

<p>“Nay, I’ve done rarely, thank ye, missis,
that I have. Now I come to think on, I’d
summat on t’road.”</p>

<p>“Nobbut a sparrow-peck, that’s what it is!
Cat would ha’ eaten more, I’m sure.”</p>

<p>“I’ve a new pipe for you, Father,” Thomas
put in, fumbling about the mantel for his gift.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span>
“Ay, an’ there’s bacca an’ all for you in a
tin.”</p>

<p>“It’s more than a while now since I’d a
pipe. Marget can’t abide smoke about a
house.”</p>

<p>“Seems she can’t abide owt as gives folk
pleasure!” Agnes carped. There was something
hurt and aggrieved in her voice that had
not been there before; something graver, as
well, as if the tone of her mind had changed.
She still sat at the table, looking straight before
her over the pots, and never once at the couple
busy with the pipe. The meal had indeed been
a sacrifice of sorts, and never a whiff of smoke
had gone up from it to heaven. The gods had
slept while the oblation was being made, and
now there was nothing to do but to clear away.
At least the fault, if there was a fault, was none
of hers. Things never happened as one expected,
of course....</p>

<p>Kit was holding the pipe limply in his hand,
another stranger pretending to be a friend. His
son’s eyes were set hopefully on his face, waiting
for a look of cheer.</p>

<p>“I’ll fill it, shall I?” he asked.</p>

<p>“You’re right kind.”</p>

<p>“Likely you’d be better suited wi’ twist!”</p>

<p>“Nay, not I. Bacca’ll do grand.”</p>

<p>Thomas said, “Yon’s the ticket!” and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span>
handed over the pipe, and Kit took it and held
it limply as before. “Where’s t’laylock?” he
asked suddenly, staring through the porch.
“You’ve never hagged down yon laylock as
used to be by t’door?”</p>

<p>“Nay, not I,” Thomas said, with honest
regret. “’Twas wind as took it—yon gale we
had in March. A terble storm it was, to be
sure! I made certain house was going an’ all.”</p>

<p>“I never heard tell as laylock was gone,” Kit
said. He spoke the words very slowly, because
he was thinking back. He remembered the
storm, and how he had never slept the whole
night long, not because he was afraid, but because
it brought the sound of the sea. The
chestnuts close to his window had been like
giants raving in the dark, and now and then
one hewed a limb from another and sent it
crashing down. He had sat in a whistling
draught and pictured the long waves breaking
on the shore, and heard the long roar of succession
filling the farmhouse. The yew tree, of
course, would neither break nor bend, and the
lilac would bend but it would never break.
Morning showed great boughs across the road,
but the trees of his dream were still untouched
and whole. No gale that blew could harm the
trees of his dream; and yet that storm had
brought the lilac down....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span></p>

<p>“I never thought on to say,” Thomas answered
with a troubled air. “I’m sorry about
laylock, but there’s a new seat down by t’hedge.
You’ll find it rarely snug, if you want to be
setting out.”</p>

<p>Kit looked through the window at the neat
new object of painted boards, set where the
light from the west would trouble and dazzle
his eyes. The seat by the lilac had been turned
away from the west, so that he might rest his
eyes on the evening peace of the fields. It had
been sheltered, too, by the tree and the porch,
so that even in winter it was warm. The new
seat looked snug in the thick of the fence, but
there was no shade over it for his head, and
when the leaves were gone the wind would
come thinly through. Worst of all, it was
painted the same colour as the meadow gate,
that terrible hard blue that was like a blow.
It was horrible what things you could do with
a pot of paint; but, then, as they knew on the
marsh, he had never cared for paint....</p>

<p>“Ay, it’s snug,” he said very politely, and
turned the pipe over in his hand.</p>

<p>“We’ll get by, then,” Thomas said, “while
missis sides the pots.” He was already, almost
thankfully, in the porch.</p>

<p>“Nay, I don’t rightly think——”</p>

<p>“What’s amiss?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span></p>

<p>“Laylock’s gone, d’ye see, and I doubt I
can’t smoke anywheres else.” He set the pipe
aside, gently, but with a final air.</p>

<p>“What, there was no laylock at Marget’s,
was there?” Thomas asked and stared.</p>

<p>“Nay, not as folk knowed.”</p>

<p>“Losh save us—what d’ye mean by that?”
Agnes stood up suddenly with a brusque
movement, and began to gather the plates
together in a pile. When she spoke it was still
without looking at either of the men. “Now,
then, don’t be fretting him, Thomas. Let him
be. He’ll find his way about, after a bit.”</p>

<p>“Gox, you talk for all the world as if he was
strange folk come to stay!”</p>

<p>“Happen there’s none so strange as them
that comes home.” The words came almost
absently from the old man’s lips, as if he was
answering, unknown to himself, some echo out
of the air. He moved away from the couple to
where the fiddle lay, and began to draw the
cloth from the taut strings. Thomas looked
from his father to his wife, but now it was she
who would not meet his eyes. With a movement
that was almost symbolic he came into
the room and shut the door; the only time, as
he knew, that it had been shut that day. He
stood in the middle of the floor between the
two who were so intent—the man bent over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span>
the fiddle and the woman over her pots. The
impulse to question was still strong in his mind,
but Agnes turned before he could speak, and
thrust the plates commandingly into his hands.</p>

<p>“Leave him be for a bit,” she said in a lowered
tone. “Likely he’s tired, and we’re bothering
him over much. Carry pots for me, will you,
there’s a good lad?”</p>

<p>He shut his mouth with an effort, and helped
her to clear away, tramping obediently between
the front kitchen and the back. Agnes went
about her business as if there were nobody
there, but Thomas could not resist an occasional
glance at the silent guest. He had drawn
the shroud away from the fiddle’s face, and
when they were not looking, he let it drop
behind the table to the floor. He drew a breath
of relief when he had done that, and felt a
little soothed now that the fiddle was in his
hands. He gathered it close to him and stood
quiet, letting his glance go stealthily round the
room. Now he could reckon every change to
the full, the paint and the new furniture and the
kitchen grate. He looked at the white-faced
clock and the table and the shelf with the books.
He looked at the new chair over and over again,
and every time he looked it was still new.
Dimly, though Agnes never guessed anything
of the sort, he realised the new carpet on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span>
stairs.... Only into the old mirror he steadily
refused to look, because of the power that lies
lurking in a glass. He looked out of the window
for his lilac tree. Once or twice he glanced
furtively at the door....</p>

<p>Thomas plodded in and out with the pots, a
little more hopeful when he was coming back, and
a little more troubled when he went away. He
said to himself again that things were wrong, that
with every minute that passed they were going
wrong. So far the old man hadn’t “settled”
in the least, and only a blind donkey could pretend
that he had. The situation which they had
plotted with such care seemed to be getting
completely out of hand. They saw their pleasant
surprises turn to disappointments as they
looked, and could do nothing but watch the
change with pained amaze. There had been
the chair and the mug, and the pipe and bacca
and the seat, and Heaven knew how many
other things besides. It was just as if they
were all bewitched and upside down, and
instead of righting themselves they were getting
deeper under the spell. He stared at the old
man standing like a stock, and felt there was
something sinister in his look. He had an air
of waiting for something, listening and looking
out—something that was a terrible time on the
road. He did not look at home in the very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span>
least—a happy old body coming home to stay.
Thomas thought it was time that somebody
said a word.... So after his last trip he
halted and spoke....</p>

<p>“Yon’ll be an old fiddle, I doubt, by now?”
“Nay. Fiddles is always young.”</p>

<p>“Old as time gangs, I mean, yon’s all.” He
looked at the shining thing that he had known
so well, and Agnes came to the inner door and
listened, drying a pot. “It’s sung Bob an’ me
to sleep many a time when we were barns.
There’s whiles I wake even yet, hearing music
somewheres in the dark.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be bound Marget’s barns isn’t fiddled
to sleep!” the young wife scoffed behind their
backs.</p>

<p>“There’s never no music at Marget’s that
she can hear.... Never a note from dawn to
dusk, barring what the birds make in the
eaves.”</p>

<p>“Ay, well, we’d music to bed and board,”
said his son. “An’ then, when we were grown
lads, we danced to fiddle instead. Nobody could
ever play up our feet like the old dad.”</p>

<p>“Many a lad and lass it’s danced into love.”</p>

<p>“Us among ’em—didn’t it, Agnes?—us an’
all! We’re married folk now,” Thomas added,
“but I reckon we can dance a bit still.”</p>

<p>Agnes finished the pot, and her eyes brightened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span>
with a new idea. “Get Father to give us
a tune,” she said, “an’ we’ll show him what
we can do, right off.”</p>

<p>“It’s over soon, I doubt.” Thomas hesitated,
taken aback. “Ay, well, why not?” he added,
with a laugh. “’Tisn’t every day as’ll bring
the old man home!”</p>

<p>“Nay, it’s over soon, as you say.” Agnes
affected to withdraw. “We’d best not worrit
him. He’s tired.”</p>

<p>“Nay, not I!” A sudden lightness and
strength came into Kit’s voice, and his face
brightened and he tried to smile. “I’ll be main
glad,” he said, and straightened his back. All
his fiddler’s pride was aroused by the implication
that he was too tired to answer the call to
his art. His hands went eagerly to the smooth
pegs, as he started to tune. Life and meaning
came back into his eyes....</p>

<p>“You’re bound to be a bit done, all the same.
I reckon we’d best let the music be, to-night.”</p>

<p>“I’m as fresh as a lemon, I tell ye!” the old
man said. His tone was suddenly testy, almost
sharp, and the young folk smiled at each other
aside.</p>

<p>“Ay, well, then, Thomas, shove the table
back. We’ll show Father we’ve got a foot to
us both yet....”</p>

<p>Thomas went for the big table with zest, his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span>
heart light in him now as a sail at sea. As if
by a miracle the whole atmosphere had cleared,
transformed in a moment by a simple speech.
Now it was sane and happy and almost gay,
just as they had always expected it to be. He
had been nearly troubled to tears by his father’s
look—that hang-dog look, that look of a trapped
beast. In the back kitchen he had questioned
Agnes as to what they had done ... what they
had left undone ... what was wrong. He
couldn’t be homesick for Marget’s after all he
had suffered at her hands, and yet even at
Marget’s he had never looked like that. There
were changes about the place, of course—and
none too soon; he couldn’t have hoped to find
it just the same. And yet all the time he seemed
to be looking out—waiting for something ...
seeking—what?</p>

<p>“He’s strange—nowt else,” Agnes said in
reply, hiding herself behind a cupboard door.</p>

<p>“Strange? In his own spot?”</p>

<p>“Ay.”</p>

<p>“Land’s sake! Whatever for?”</p>

<p>“Nay, I don’t know,” she answered, still
hiding behind the door. “Old folks is easy put
about, but he’ll not be strange long.” Her own
confidence had been sadly shaken by the failure
of the meal, and then suddenly she had remembered
the room upstairs. They ought to have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span>
known that coming home made people sorry as
well as glad, but the night when it came would
bring its special peace. To-morrow they would
look back and wonder what had gone awry....
But she did not want to remind Thomas of that
upstairs room. He would be telling his father
before he could be stopped, clumsily forestalling
the first effect. So she listened in silence and
let him worry away, pushing his cap further and
further to the back of his puzzled head. All
she did was to hide behind the door, and say in
the pause that “he wouldn’t be strange long.”</p>

<p>And then, after all, the change had come about
long before there was any sign of night. Thomas
couldn’t help feeling terribly set up because at
last he had thought of the tactful thing to say.
It was true that it was Agnes who had suggested
the dance, but the opening remark about the
fiddle had been his. They should have turned
the talk upon fiddles long before, and then
perhaps they would have had a decent meal.
The old man’s trouble, whatever it had been,
seemed to have slipped right away now that he
was about to give them a tune. The very look
of him had altered, almost out of belief. His
eyes were young again and his movements were
certain and brisk. He leaned against the table
with the fiddle under his chin, trying the single
notes with his finger and the chords with his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span>
fine bow. The fiddle answered him in a full,
penetrating voice, ringing loud in the airy house
that had no neighbour but the sea. He bent
his ear to it and fixed his eyes on the strings,
his whole being absorbed by the presence behind
the voice....</p>

<p>“I doubt there’s not over much room.”
Thomas gave the last piece of furniture a final
shove. “There’s not that many on us, though,
to get in each other’s road. I reckon we don’t
need Harry Dixon’s barn.”</p>

<p>“There’s nowt like a dance in a barn.” Kit
spoke dreamily, without so much as lifting his
head. “There it be, all light and laughing
inside, and outside all the gert night looking in
through the doors. It’s summer, happen, wi’
folk coming through the meadow-grass, holding
their gowns to keep’em off the dew. An’ t’others
coming along the lanes, wi’ the sound o’ beck-water
rushing by.”</p>

<p>“Ay. Yon’s how it was,” Thomas said gently.
“Wasn’t it, lass?”</p>

<p>“Ay,” Agnes said, and sighed. “A bonny
time!”</p>

<p>“There’s bettermer times now,” he insisted
stoutly, but she shook her head. She knew
already that there were no “bettermer” times.</p>

<p>Now they had cleared the room as much as
they could, and were standing together in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span>
middle of the floor. It had hurt Agnes a little
to have to upset the room, even in so pleasant a
cause as this. She had spent so long in planning
it all out, and now you might have thought,
from the look of things, that it was the night
before a sale. The new chair, that had sat so
smugly on the hearth, had been pushed into a
corner to look on, as well as the little footstool
that she had covered with red cloth. This was
the chair’s first lesson in life, if she had known;
it would never be quite such a smug outsider,
after this.... But she had liked to see it
neatly on the hearth, just as she had preferred
the table spread with food, and this sudden dismantling
hurt her homely pride. Yet the
comfort and order had done nothing to cheer
the poor old man who was looking for a home.
He hadn’t even begun to look happy until it
was done away. She felt a moment’s terrible
qualm for the sanctuary upstairs....</p>

<p>“Now, then, folks—get yourselves set!”
Kit stopped his tuning and threw up his head,
his eyes roving commandingly over the room.
He refused a chair and settled himself firmly
against the table edge. His face had hardened
a little, and his mouth was stern. He was
master now, as he had always been when he
played, half-god and artist, never the hireling
of the crowd. Gentle as he was in everything<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span>
else, he was always supremely the autocrat in
this. Once he had quitted a ball at its very
height, because the dancers had gone against
his will. Now, as he motioned the couple into
place, the sweep of his bow was like the sweep
of a sword....</p>

<p>“Baint it fine to see him so pleased?” Agnes
whispered, as she took her stand. Just for a
moment they felt foolish standing there, this
serious, new-wed couple with their brand-new
house. But the dancing that was bred in them
soon got the better of that, as well as the growing
atmosphere of the past. Almost at once
they threw themselves into their parts as Kit
had thrown himself into his. Thomas became
the fiercely-diffident youth, whose feet had
always been nimbler than his tongue; Agnes,
the spoilt favourite of a crowded ball. She
turned to the old man with a smile that had
won her many a tune before to-day.</p>

<p>“Be it a reel, Mr. Fiddler? I hope it’s a
reel.”</p>

<p>“Ay, it’s a reel,” he conceded with a lordly
nod, though he had settled to give them a reel
from the very start.</p>

<p>Thomas said, “Ay, make it a reel!” in a
gruff, shy voice, the voice of the youth whose
only way of expression was through his dancing
feet. All of them felt the thrill of the word each<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span>
time that it was said, the lilt and beat of the
tune in their brains and heels. The old feeling
came back that life was only lived from dance
to dance. The ecstasy came back, the almost
insolent sense of power; the passion of motion,
the thrill of mutual purpose and touch. The
very air of the kitchen seemed to change and
become mistily lamp-lit, throbbing to many
hearts. Over the house there was no longer the
clear arch of the evening light, but a roof of
darkness, powdered with steady stars. The
man and the girl felt dancers all around; sometimes
they touched a shoulder or an arm. They
were all waiting for the fiddle to begin, lasses in
bright colours, and lads in their best clothes.
Now and then somebody laughed or threw a
challenge across the room, but as soon as the
music started they would all be dumb. Through
the mist showed the warm colours and shining
hair, bright eyes and gleaming teeth, young,
happy faces, and figures come to their first
strength. They were all friends and acquaintances
who were there, folks who had danced
together through the round of the years. Agnes
saw smiling girlish faces in the crowd, and men’s
eyes that smiled and lingered on hers. Once
she saw Marget, young and trim and cold; and
Bob watching her, sulking by a door. She saw
Thomas, the Thomas she had lost, who was no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span>
more the man she had married than any in the
room. What that Thomas had given her she
would never find again, the breathless vision of
the unexplored. The dogged face, the brooding,
pleading eyes, the touch of a spirit strange to
her as yet—even the memory of them caught
her by the throat. She found her heart beating
and her cheek grown hot. This life in her hands
to crown or throw away ... no, there was
never another moment quite like that.</p>

<p>The little sordidness came creeping back. “I
wish Marget could clap eyes on the old man
now!”</p>

<p>“Ay, so do I!”</p>

<p>Kit waved again. “Whisht, will ye! I’m
just off.”</p>

<p>“Right, Father! We’re ready.”</p>

<p>“We’re all set.”</p>

<p>“Now!”</p>

<p>He lifted his bow high, and the atmosphere
tightened like a string. It was like waiting for
the striking of a flame, the first touch of lips,
or the dead coming out of a grave. All the grace
of youth was in the curve of his arm; the certainty
of his knowledge in his thrilling finger-tips.
He leaned his ear to the fiddle as to a
secret bound to be told. His face held expression
behind expression, like the endless perspective
of images in a pool, but at the back of all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span>
was the passionate gravity of the artist at his
task. Old as he was, the sense of power that
was strong in the others was stronger far in him.
All who had ever danced to his piping waited
upon his nod; feet by the hundred ached for
the loosed tune. Now, now, before all the gods
he was a god, as well....</p>

<p>And then slowly, as the note still hung in the
balance, his face chilled and changed. The
fiddle was as full of music as it would hold, but
just for the moment it would not give it up. All
those months of silence it had been singing to
itself, and now the racing torrent was choking
its throat. Slowly his bow sank ... slowly
... and sank....</p>

<p>“Nay, it’s ganged.”</p>

<p>“What’s ganged, Father?”</p>

<p>“The music.”</p>

<p>“It’ll come back right enough,” Thomas said
in a cheerful tone. “Let’s see if I can mind the
tune.” He pursed his lips to whistle, thought a
moment, and began. “Yon’s it.”</p>

<p>“Ay, yon’s it.” He bent to the fiddle again.
“I’ve got it now.” The moment that was like
a sharpened string drew to its length again and
snapped like a string.... “Nay, I’ve not.”</p>

<p>“It’s like this, you’ll think on,” Agnes put in.
She started to hum the air in a gay little voice,
and Kit nodded his head and listened and said
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span>
“Ay.” She beat out the time with her foot,
and the fiddle went up and down. Then he
lifted his bow and waited ... and listened
again.... “Nay, it’s ganged.”</p>

<p>“We’ll give him a lead, missis!” Thomas
cried, and began to whistle the music
very loud. At once they flung themselves
eagerly into the dance, lithe, earnest figures
making their neat, light steps. As they danced
he whistled and she sang, until the house was
filled with the tune from floor to roof. The
very flags of the kitchen seemed to sway to the
air; it seemed impossible that the old man
could not hear. Faster and faster they speeded
it up, and, as they whirled, their eyes met once
and again, and then they smiled. Every moment
they looked for the fiddle to join in,
putting fresh life and rhythm into their feet.
And instead they heard the old man’s voice
crying aloud, harsh with the harshness of great
pain and fear. He struck the table soundingly
with his open palm.</p>

<p>“Whisht, will ye? Whisht! Didn’t I say it
was ganged?”</p>

<p>Now he was straight on his feet and gazing
blankly round, not seeming to see them where
they had fallen apart.... “There’s nowt left
o’ the things I used to know.”</p>

<p>“You’re out o’ practice,” Thomas murmured<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span>
in an uncertain tone; and Agnes added—“It’s
Marget’s blame, for never letting you play.”</p>

<p>“Ay, but she let me nurse fiddle on my knee,
and tunes was singing in my head all the time.
Now I’ve come back and they waint sing no
more.”</p>

<p>“You’ll see they’ll sing right enough afore so
long.”</p>

<p>He covered them again with the same unseeing
eyes.</p>

<p>“I’d ha’ done better to stop where I were.”</p>

<p>Agnes put out her hand at that with a little
cry. “Nay, now, Father, you mustn’t talk
like that!”</p>

<p>“At Marget’s I see this spot as plain as
plain, and my missis stirring through the rooms.
I see the bits o’ sticks we bought when we was
wed, and the hearth where we set together of a
night. But now I’m back I can’t see any o’
they things no more.”</p>

<p>“Times change, dad,” pleaded his son, “but
we’ll make you comfortable, I’m sure.”</p>

<p>“You can’t bring back the dead to the lone
living. You can’t put back the laylock by the
door.”</p>

<p>“Nay, I wish I could!” Thomas’s face fell.</p>

<p>“At Marget’s I had ’em both.”</p>

<p>“It’s your old home, think on,” Agnes said
wistfully, but he shook his head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span></p>

<p>“’Tisn’t home when the music’s all ganged.”</p>

<p>A silence fell on the three of them after that,
the silence of helplessness ceasing from futile
speech. There are things that cannot happen
to our desire because we have stopped the way
for them ourselves. The gains of life are all of
them had through loss, and for every coin that
we take at least we must put a counter down.
The old and the young folks had both shut a door
at their backs, and when they tried to get through
to each other the doors were barred. Kit knew
that, since the music had failed, there was no
place for him here. The music could only live
where the dream lived, and he had left it behind.
He had always risked the counters of life for
fairy gold, and now all that remained to him
was his invisible treasure of the heart. Comfort,
position, peace in his last days—all must go
into the fire to serve the fine flame of his dream.
He was only a vague old man who had made
a muddle of life, but firmly and fightingly he
was sure of that. There was nothing here for
him but the shell of lovely things grown strange.
That which he had made for himself he might
have, but nothing else. “For what we take
we must pay, and the price is cruel hard.”</p>

<p>And Thomas and Agnes, with their unaccepted
oblation of satisfaction and thanks? They,
too, had taken, and would have to pay....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span></p>

<p>“You’ll settle after a bit,” Thomas argued,
but his voice was flat.</p>

<p>“I’ll never settle, not I.”</p>

<p>“It’s early days to say that.”</p>

<p>For the first time Kit looked him firmly in
the face.</p>

<p>“I’m going back to Marget,” he declared
aloud.</p>

<p>Agnes uttered a sharp cry, and Thomas
flushed. “Nay, Father, you’re not,” he answered,
setting his mouth.</p>

<p>“Ay, but I am that. I shouldn’t ha’ come.
Folks as gang once should bide away.”</p>

<p>“What, she’s as bad to you as an old witch!”
Agnes broke out. “She’s been bad to you all
along. She doesn’t do right by you at all.”</p>

<p>“I care nowt for that if I have the rest.”
The stress and anguish had gone out of his face,
as well as the look that sought and couldn’t
find. He looked older and frailer, but he looked
certain and secure. The little strength that he
had was going fast, but he would never have to
try it like this again. He took a firm step towards
the door, but Thomas put himself in
between.</p>

<p>“Nay, then, you’ll gang none!” he said
through his shut teeth. The dark flush rose in
his face to the roots of his hair. His voice was
suddenly brutal, fierce and coarse. “What-like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span>
fools d’ye think we’ll look?” he cried;
“and after all the trouble we’ve took an’ all?”</p>

<p>“I’ve got to gang,” Kit told him, looking
him in the eyes.</p>

<p>“Well, you waint, an’ that’s flat!”</p>

<p>“Let me gang,” the old man begged.</p>

<p>“Couldn’t you bide just the one night?”
Agnes coaxed. She came across to him and laid
a hand on his arm. “You’ll feel a deal better
in t’morn, I’m sure, and it’s real comfortable
upstairs.”</p>

<p>“I’m feared to gang upstairs....” He
shrank away from her, letting her hand drop.
His eyes hated her—hostile, terrible eyes. He
returned to the door. “Now, lad, get by.”</p>

<p>“Nay.”</p>

<p>He let himself go then, and became all fear
and rage, a wild old creature fighting and raving
to be free. “I’ll not bide—I waint!” he cried,
his voice rising and cracking as it rose. “I
can’t bide. I mun seek they things as is gone
an’ lost!” He clubbed the fiddle and came at
his son with it raised in the air. “Mun I crack
fiddle over thy danged head?”</p>

<p>“Let him be, the poor old man!” Agnes cried,
weeping aloud, but Thomas’s attitude had already
changed. The futile act of defiance had
shown him plainly the nature of his father’s
need. He must be out of himself to risk his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span>
precious fiddle like that! He felt ashamed of
himself, too, for bringing that evil into his kindly
face. He moved away from the door, his expression
softened, almost shocked. “Don’t
take on,” he said gently. “You shall gang if
you want.”</p>

<p>“I can gang to Marget?” Kit demanded,
hard of faith.</p>

<p>“Ay, if you’re that set.”</p>

<p>“We’d best be off, then, or we’ll be missing
Bob.” He was still shaking a little in every
limb, but now it was with excitement and relief.
Close to the door, “Where’s t’bundle?” he
asked, wheeling round in a sudden scare.
Marget would give it him, he knew, if he left
the bundle behind. When he had left Marget’s
he had seemed half-dazed, hypnotised, as it
were, into going against his will. Now he was
all bustle and business, thinking for himself,
straining every nerve to get away....</p>

<p>“Here’s t’bundle.” Thomas took the red
handkerchief from his wife.</p>

<p>“You’ve gone and hid my hat!” Again his
voice rose.</p>

<p>“Nay, it’s here.”</p>

<p>The sun was leaving the kitchen at long last,
but it was still smoothly golden on the sands.
In garden and orchard the shadows were
growing long, and the yew had a passing brother<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</span>
on the ground. Out at sea there was a new life
stirring, a new tide coming out of the deep,
but where Agnes stood in the kitchen a vapoury
shadow grew, pointing and reaching and deepening
towards the stair.... Suddenly she ran
to the old man and caught him round the neck.</p>

<p>“Eh, if you would nobbut try!” she said,
with tears. “I can’t abide to think o’ you
going back to yon hard woman and poor house!”</p>

<p>He waited patiently while she held him, but
his eyes moved on. “It’s never a poor house,”
he said, “where folks find their dreams....
Good-bye, my lass,” he added, kindly enough,
and hurried out, and did not stumble as he
crossed the door. Thomas had to lengthen his
stride to catch him on the path.</p>

<p>“I’ll be best wi’ Marget,” Agnes heard him
say, and almost at once she heard him say it
again. She watched him until he was through
the garden gate, but he never once looked back.
Out of the sea-window she saw the tide come in.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
